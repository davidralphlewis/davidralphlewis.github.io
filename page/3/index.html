<p>Your library is now scattered.<br />

by chance in second-hand markets,<br />
hardbacks with messages inscribed<br />
on the first page, the much read,<br />
the dogeared, the pristine copies,<br />
the underlined, all now are removed<br />
from your shelves and returned back<br />
to the world. Those words were always<br />
loaned. Given the absence of you,<br />
the catalogue that arranged the spines,<br />
we dispersed piles to charity shops,<br />
disintegrated each memory and each<br />
sentimental gift. Your neurons too,<br />
were always borrowed, now separated<br />
into atoms and thrown back into<br />
the wild universe, to be reused or<br />
discarded or recombined into new<br />
words, new combinations, new life.</p>

<p>Sunflowers in November.</p>

<p>A hospital before the backup<br />

the breakdown of negotiations<br />
between selfish men, far away.</p>

<p>Nebulae the size of our<br />
solar system in colours<br />
unimaginable and invisible.</p>

<p>Weston-Super-Mare beach<br />
at low tide. Those discarded<br />
phones that lie in a drawer,<br />
former luxuries, former heights<br />
of technology that collect dust<br />
and wait to be useful again.</p>

<p>The wind after a storm.</p>

<p>A warlord sat by themselves<br />
on a plastic chair, in a<br />
featurless room, waiting.</p>

<p>Those three am thoughts.</p>

to hear a single deep syllable,<br />
one that echoes through their body,<br />
into the dark caverns of the self,<br />
shaking the silver wings of secrets.</p>

<p>Understand the hills are fickle,<br />
there is never any guarantee.</p>

<p>Take your thickest coat. The nights<br />
are unforgiving. Take a thermos,<br />
for a link to your waking life.<br />
Walk across the fields, to the<br />
centre of the silence, where the<br />
earth dreams. Place your hands<br />
gently down onto the damp soil.<br />
Slow your heartbeat and wait.</p>

as I enter, inch by inch,<br />
“but what’s a few million years between<br />
friends? I know why<br />
you abandoned me for land. I forgive you”</p>

<p>Every part of my body<br />
is held so tenderly as I submerge my head,<br />
the cold slowing all<br />
anxieties. I realise I have always been a wave,<br />
never the same from<br />
one moment to the next, always dissolving<br />
into surf. I watch<br />
my worries float away, turn into foam.</p>

<p>I kick forward,<br />
make the first stroke and the water murmurs<br />
“Welcome home”</p>

<hr />

<p>Prompt was “Why are you swimming and how long are you in the water?” from the Poetry from the time of being alone group. I love swimming and miss it a lot.</p>

as light starts to intensify, obliterating<br />
all detail. Trees will become indistinct<br />
shapes in the mist, never coalescing<br />
into objects. The grass will flicker<br />
with blue fire sparks, but that will<br />
be the least of my problems. Walls,<br />
so dependable and solid, will become<br />
transparent as the hungry light feeds.</p>

<p>“Bring it on!” I will shout towards the<br />
rapidly dissolving sky. “So predictable!<br />
You’re not even trying!” I will scream<br />
as the outline of my body transforms<br />
into scattered pencil smudges, as my<br />
carbon is disassembled, as I become<br />
the cyclone. “C minus!!” I will shout,<br />
“Unlucky, try a lot harder next time!”</p>

I’ve tried different approaches,<br />

“Did you see the game last night?”<br />

remain stubbornly shy. Perhaps<br />
I have not found the right topic.</p>

<p>Some nights the floorboards creak<br />
out curses as they shrink or expand.<br />
At times, the computer sings softly<br />
to itself, a single note to clarify<br />
the air. I have heard these stories<br />
too often, consider their secrets dull.</p>

<p>I know the walls understand more<br />
than they let on, but I am unnerved<br />
by their lack of reply. “It’s OK,”<br />
I whisper, late at night, palm on<br />
the cool bricks “You can trust me.”<br />
They remain speechless. All I hear<br />
is my own breath, slow and patient,<br />
and outside the persistent muttering<br />
of winds, yearning to find a way in.</p>

I was fiddling with a new set of code in the middle section of the input. I don’t work with the programme directly of course. It’s beyond us now. No-one has any idea what it’s doing. It’s meant to be running simulations to find a solution to the energy crisis but it doesn’t do anything.</p>

<p class="western">It was one in the morning. Maybe two. Most of the time its just me and a screen. Sometimes the text dances, my head spins, the world becomes distant. I should probably stop when this happens, but I never do.</p>

down from the north, over city towers,<br />
consuming mountains, farms and futures.<br />
A new ice age. Mostly I woke, limbs numb,<br />
wondering how I would endure the day.</p>

stroke my skin and breathed in<br />

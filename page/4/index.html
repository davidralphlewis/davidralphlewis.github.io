millennia ago to keep us placid.<br />
Reality is narrated to us daily.<br />
Your thoughts are not your own.<br />
You are code blind, lost within<br />
a procedurally generated lie.<br />

stars, memories of new places.</p>

<p>You say I’m not making sense,<br />
that you are worried about me,<br />
not knowing you speak in lines<br />
written for you. We walk home,<br />
or appear to, arm in arm along<br />
the canal, agreeing to exist<br />
within fiction a little longer.</p>

<p>When we are asleep, the program<br />
malfunctions, showing us glimpses<br />
of new scenarios, other realities.</p>

<p>Today’s prompt was conspiracy theories from the Poetry at the time of being alone group.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to be on a couple of podcasts recently.

<p>Prompt was  “Redo- a poem of recreation, change and makeovers” from the poetry at the time of being alone group. Not super happy with this one but tomorrow is another day.</p>

Slugs circle, waiting.</p>

We eat them raw, tongues rejoicing.</p>

We split dried husks,<br />
store spherical spells<br />
in envelopes labelled<br />
in pencil and wait for<br />
the return of the sun.</p>

<p>Prompt for today was “Write an overheard poem” from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/">Amy Kay Poetry</a> on Instagram. The title comes from something I overheard years ago and have been waiting to use ever since. I didn’t expect it to turn out like this.</p>

<p>Prompt was “Write a poem that includes the words ‘flock’ ‘simmer’ and ‘sway” I misread simmer for shimmer. I drafted one poem and didn’t like it, so I ran it through a <a href="http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php">cut up machine</a>, which twisted my words. Then I wrote out from that.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/my%20writing/2016/03/30/on-writing-and-publishing-a-book.html">On Writing and Publishing a Book</a><p>Last Good Friday, I found myself hunched over the computer, fiddling with styles and formatting while outside was bright sunshine. It was all in aid of getting my first collection of short stories published, <em>Amber Stars</em>.</p>

<p>The book started as a couple of stories and ideas I was playing around with in private. I wrote <em>Welcome Home</em> and <em>The Underworld</em> mostly for myself. It was an exercise in keeping my fingers busy. I often have quite a few writing projects on the go and these stories were just another one I was going to keep to myself. My tendency is to write lots and share little, which is probably the wrong way round.</p>

<p>Anyway, I started to write a few more stories. I imagined them to be set in the same town. Writing more, I thought they could possibly take place over the same night.</p>

<p>It was only really after the first draft that I decided to go all in and publish it as an ebook. Instead of something for my own amusement, it was now something that was going to be public. This came with significantly more pressure. Overall though, working on a project and knowing I would definitely release it to an audience meant I strived to improve it much more. I think being outside of my comfort zone was helpful in improving my writing as I agonised over every word. I revised all the stories multiple times, completing draft after draft</p>

<p>After all this work, it was strange to finally release the book into the wild. Actually producing the ebook was a lot easier than I imagined and it has been really gratifying to receive feedback from friends and family who have purchased it. I’m glad I’ve done it.</p>

<p>Now to start work on the next one.</p>

            <a class="post-link" href="/art%20from%20others/2016/03/08/marbles-and-creation.html">Marbles and Creation</a><p>Why not take five minutes out of your day to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvUU8joBb1Q]">watch this:</a></p>

<p>It’s an incredible machine made by <a href="http://wintergatan.bandcamp.com/">Wintergatan</a>. Overly complicated and intricate, it is fully programmable and has the ability to play the melody, bass and drums all at the same time while changing key halfway through the song. It took the artist fourteen months to build.</p>

<p>What I think is most spectacular about it is that is has no reason to exist. There are much easier ways of playing the same tune, but none of them are quite as fun. This machine is an act of creation for creation’s sake, nothing more.</p>

<p>Often when we are evaluating art, we want to ask about the artist’s intentions. Why did they make it? What are they trying to impart? What deeper meaning can be gleamed from a close analysis of the object? This is perfectly fine and valid for a lot of deep and Very Serious art.</p>

<p>Sometimes though, things just exist because someone decided to create it. The only reason this machine exists is that the artist wanted to make it. Once that decision was made, they spent ages building it and perfecting it. Now it exists and it is glorious. There’s no bigger meaning or deep point being made.</p>

<p>The mere act of creation is what gives the machine its power.</p>

<p>Plus that melody is great.</p>

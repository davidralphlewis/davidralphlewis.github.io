<p>Recently, I was speaking to someone about journaling, and I casually mentioned I'd kept a diary consistently for over ten years. As I said it, it seemed wrong, so I checked the next day. Yup. Over ten years.</p>

<p>'You don't want to end up like me,'<br>
the man on stage screeches.<br>
Laughter unstoppable now, like<br>
a falling body embracing gravity.<br>
'I'm serious. Why is that funny?'<br>
I feel three hundred people's heat</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-03-08-When-I-took-my-mattress/">When I took my mattress my duvet and their dreams</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z">March 8, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>I said I was keeping them for safety and I almost believed it. I laid down in the middle of the nearest woodland and named it Mine. I rigged canvas between two branches but the wind whistled through my bone marrow. Waking in the night, I started a fire, using their dreams as kindling. I had plenty to spare. Still I did not sleep soundly, So I felled the ancient oaks and built a bed frame from the trunks, raising myself above the cold ground. When this failed, I chopped down every tree I could see, whittled and planed the wood to planks, transformed the land to make myself a shelter, created walls around my bed to define outside.</p>

<p>We are racing against the dying of the day<br>
over fields flooded with twigs and silence<br>
towards a broiling bruise left by a canula,<br>
our tinny engine whine now a mosquito.</p>

<i><time datetime="2024-02-13T00:00:00.000Z">February 13, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>I am driving home at night<br>
hands gripping the wheel<br>
empty tarmac surrounding me<br>
fertiliser stinging my nostrils<br>
The engine shaking all the space<br>
between my scattered atoms</p>

<p>I love performing poetry at open mics and often write poems specifically for performance. This poem is one that is written for the stage, not the page. I read at <a href="https://solpoetry.org.uk/">Satellite of Love</a>'s wonderful open mic recently and <a href="https://linktr.ee/barryhollow">Barry Hollow</a> was kind enough to film it.</p>

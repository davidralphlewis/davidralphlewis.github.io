<p>It's been a good year for books. I've finished 42 this year (<a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books24">here's the full list</a>) which is a little below usual, but I've enjoyed savouring and taking my time with them. Currently I'm halfway through <em>Don Quixote</em> and unlikely to finish before the new year. So here are my favourite books of the year in arbitrary categories.</p>

<p>In this Christmas film, Tiny Tim is wrapped<br>
in yellowed sheets, fever embracing him tight.<br>
Unnamed family members stand round the bed<br>
muttering 'rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb' to give<br>
the illusion of speech. Not long to go now.<br>
Then a swell of strings, spotlight narrows -<br>
A miracle! Tiny Tim sits upright in bed<br>
and starts to tell weeping extras a story of</p>

<p>This is my five hundredth post on this website. I've had this site since 2016 in various forms. During that time, it's become one of the most valuable things I've done.</p>

<p>All these whirring, vibrant blurs,<br>
this rare and joyous music,<br>
the sensation of breeze over bare skin<br>
as I twirl in the summer sun<br>
dizzy, exhilarated, smiling-</p>

<p>I have stumbled into the season of crows.<br>
Still silhouettes watch my lethargic bones<br>
shuffle through leaf murk into the gloom.</p>

<p>those placeholders for unspoken<br>
sorrow, please send instead<br>
the first sunny morning in spring<br>
when mist evaporates like breath<br>
as buildings and smiles are preserved<br>
in amber. Send vivid, realistic dreams<br>
where you reunite with long dead<br>
friends who embrace you and laugh<br>
and ask 'Why you are so distressed,<br>
can't you see everything is fine?'</p>

<p>I hadn't been to a poetry event in a little while, so when I saw <a href="https://m.facebook.com/MilkPoetry/">Milk Poetry</a> were doing a special horror themed slam I signed up immediately. My work has often traded in the bizarre and surreal, mixing elements of horror in with poetry so it seemed a good fit.
I performed <a href="https://davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/posts/2024-05-03-g%20man/">G-Man</a>  which has become a favourite of mine. I didn't win, but that's not really the point of slams for me. It was exciting to see so many horror poets perform.</p>

<p>Around July of this year, my site threw a strange error while deploying. Usually I would spend a while googling how to fix it so I carry on as I was. But I was growing dissatisfied with my static site generator Jekyll anyway, so I threw the whole site out and rebuilt it using a different program called Eleventy. It's still a work in progress but it does most of what I wanted it to do.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-03-08-When-I-took-my-mattress/">When I took my mattress my duvet and their dreams</a> </h2>

<p>I said I was keeping them for safety and I almost believed it. I laid down in the middle of the nearest woodland and named it Mine. I rigged canvas between two branches but the wind whistled through my bone marrow. Waking in the night, I started a fire, using their dreams as kindling. I had plenty to spare. Still I did not sleep soundly, So I felled the ancient oaks and built a bed frame from the trunks, raising myself above the cold ground. When this failed, I chopped down every tree I could see, whittled and planed the wood to planks, transformed the land to make myself a shelter, created walls around my bed to define outside.</p>

<p>We are racing against the dying of the day<br>
over fields flooded with twigs and silence<br>
towards a broiling bruise left by a canula,<br>
our tinny engine whine now a mosquito.</p>

<p>I am driving home at night<br>
hands gripping the wheel<br>
empty tarmac surrounding me<br>
fertiliser stinging my nostrils<br>
The engine shaking all the space<br>
between my scattered atoms</p>

<p>I love performing poetry at open mics and often write poems specifically for performance. This poem is one that is written for the stage, not the page. I read at <a href="https://solpoetry.org.uk/">Satellite of Love</a>'s wonderful open mic recently and <a href="https://linktr.ee/barryhollow">Barry Hollow</a> was kind enough to film it.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about creative 'rules' and how arbituary they are. As it's the new year, I've been wondering where I want to take my poetry and my creativity and have decided I want to do it for its own sake. I want to focus more on the wellbeing aspects of writing and making things rather than the end result.</p>

the island. These winding lanes</p>

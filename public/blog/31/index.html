<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-03-22-distraction-by-design/">Distraction by Design: Observations on Television</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-03-22T00:00:00.000Z">March 22, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Over three years ago, I stopped watching TV. I didn't have one in the house I was in, so I just stopped. At first, it was strange to not constantly have noise and visual distraction. But soon, I didn't miss it. I preferred the silence and space to think, giving myself time to immerse myself in reading and writing. Television felt mind-numbing in comparison. I did not miss switching my brain off. In the same way as I occasionally need to <a href="/step-away-from-the-internet/">disconnect from the internet</a> to improve my attention, I never got another television because I found myself more attentive and more engaged with the world around me. As these things usually go, it soon became a pledge. I didn't need television and I could no longer understand the obsession with it. Sure, this removed me out of a lot of conversations, but I preferred the space and time not watching the box gave me.</p>

<p>Finally, after 9 months of legal battles and <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">back and forth</a> in parliament, it looks like Article 50 is about to be triggered and the UK can start its negotiations with the EU. No going back from that point. It seems since the vote months ago that hard Brexit is now a religion, an unstoppable dogma that cannot be argued with. The UK is willing to sacrifice almost everything for the promised hard Brexit. Turn this island into a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-threatens-eu-with-tax-haven-hard-brexit-plan-ready-to-do-so-if-eu-blocks-trade-migration-deal_uk_587cbbdae4b04a8bfe6af15b">tax haven?</a> Sure, why not. Public Services? Tories were getting rid of them anyway. Even the United Kingdom itself <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/second-scottish-independence-live-referendum-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-speech-second-indy-ref-2-uk-eu-a7626746.html">is being sacrificed</a> on the pyre. It's become an absolute destination and damn the consequences.</p>

<p>If you are a woolly liberal like me, someone who believes in compassion for all and the importance of civil liberties, then these are dark times. The prevalent mood, both in the UK and the USA appears to be an inward turning nationalism, a conservative rhetoric that is looking backwards to some imagined age rather than forward to the future. There's an emphasis on military spending and reducing the state. The hard-won luxuries we enjoy, such as the NHS, are continually being eroded, while at the same time the super rich refuse to pay any more tax. The gap between the rich and poor is growing. Trump is in the White House, whereas in the UK we have the authoritarian Theresa May hell bent on sending the country over a cliff. It's easy to despair and hard to see any hope.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, congratulations. You have successfully made your way into the belly of the <em>Penumbra</em>. The journey to this point has been difficult. I know, because I did it myself.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-02-08-george-saunders-and-normalisation/">George Saunders and Normalisation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z">February 8, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>In these days of increasing insanity in the world of politics, I find myself thinking more and more about the fiction of George Saunders. He understands that humans will adapt to any situation, however bizarre and will build their identities around it, even if that situation is horrifying. Many of his characters rebel against the situations, or come to the realisation that, like Brexit or Trump, this is not normal. Since I read <em>Tenth of December</em> last year, the beautifully crafted short stories have become more and more relevant to the modern age. We seem to be living the surreal sci-fi world that Saunders created.</p>

<i><time datetime="2017-02-02T00:00:00.000Z">February 2, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Every few months or so, an article comes around that reminds me I'm spending too much time on the internet, looking at pointless things and wasting time. This time, it was <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-i-got-my-attention-back-c7fc9297d347#.ggm3ob4j1">this</a> article by Craig Mod that caught my attention. It made me realise that I was once again endlessly flicking between the same sites, watching <a href="http://twitter.com/davidralphlewis">Twitter</a> refresh and reading the same articles over and over. It was an eloquently argued wake-up call.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-25-alternative-facts/">Alternative facts and the rule of misinformation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-25T00:00:00.000Z">January 25, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Bloody hell, what a terrible phrase 'Alternative facts' is. Similar to last years '<a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">post-truth</a>' that the UK media were so fond of last year, it seems the Americans are catching up to the Orwellian double-speak where 2+2 is 5 and nothing is as it seems.</p>

<p>I am here today to announce there is nothing wrong. Nothing at all. Everything is fine. Rumours you may have heard to the contrary are simply that- rumours. Do not worry in the slightest. Do not worry about the Shadowlands. They do not exist because everything is fine.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-10-enduring-art-same-as-it-ever-was/">Enduring art (Same as it ever was)</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z">January 10, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I was listening to the rather excellent <a href="http://cosmicgenome.com/shambles/">Book Shambles </a>podcast the other day. It is a rambling discussion about books and literature, usually with a guest to guide the discussion. One of the hosts, Robin Ince, mentioned <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, saying that every time he reads it he finds new insight in its pages. It's my experience that despite being a relatively slim novella, the complex characters and removed perspective provides a wealth of wisdom and observations. It got me thinking about art that endures throughout your life, that helps to shape you at different moments. I think this is one of the qualities of the best art, that each time you go back to it it is richer and more in-depth than before. Re-readings and re-watchings allow for greater emotional impact, instead of diminishing returns. The art endures throughout your life.</p>

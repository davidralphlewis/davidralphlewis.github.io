<p>At the start of the year, we tend to set goals and resolutions. This year is going to be the year I start eating healthy, the year I finally learn guitar or the year I start running. Then, inevitably, around this time every year, most of the resolutions are discarded or broken. Maybe they never even started.</p>

<p>Much like I did last year, I thought I'd take some time to linger on what I enjoyed this year. I've already written up my thoughts on <a href="/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/">the terrible events in politics</a>. This will be much more positive.<!--more--></p>

<p>So the year isn't technically over yet. There's still a good couple of weeks for things to go completely south. I'm travelling first thing next year so I thought I'd get my year in review in early.</p>

<p>Hello? This is Frank. I came in yesterday to pick up the keys for flat 65. OK? I don't see why you have to look it up on the computer, it was only yesterday. I didn't speak to one of your colleagues, no, I spoke to you. I remember you. Blonde hair. You were doing your nails. I came by about 3 pm?</p>

<p>It's been a while, hasn't it? How are you? Are you still doing that thing with them and everything else? Oh really? Good to hear.</p>

<p>I'm delighted to feature again on the latest <em>Lies, Dreaming</em> podcast from the brilliant people at <em>Poetry as Fuck</em>. It's a small little story about lost treasure. I hope you like it, let me know what you think! Find the podcast at the link below.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the business of moving across the country. I'm packing up my whole life into boxes. Every time I move I forget how all consuming and stressful it is. Foolishly, I thought I could carry on writing this blog whilst I was moving. Clearly, I was wrong. I've had no time to write at all. Life has got in the way.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-07-05-glastonbury-festival-thoughts/">Suspend the outside world for a while: Thoughts on Glastonbury Festival</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-07-05T00:00:00.000Z">July 5, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Posts on this blog have been a bit scarce for the last couple of weeks, mostly because I spent a several days in a field in Somerset. I listened to music, watched comedy and saw the odd <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/24/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-unity-in-glastonbury-speech">politician</a>. [^1] I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/">Glastonbury Festival</a>, a cornucopia of delights that I have gone to since I was fifteen.  This was my seventh time at the festival. I have been to others in the meantime, but it remains the original and the best. It is a marvellous tent town where the outside world is put on hold for a while, where the normal rules no longer apply and where art and hope rules above everything else.  I thought I'd write about why it remains so special to me and many others.</p>

<p>I'm going to be featured in an upcoming anthology from <a href="https://feversofthemind.wordpress.com/">Fevers of the Mind</a>. The editor, David L O'Nan, asked for suggestions for a playlist of the music of 2020 whilst he was compiling it. So although last year is receding fast[^1] , here are some songs that I enjoyed.</p>

<p>Due to the sickening events of yesterday in the USA, I found myself thinking back to when I was studying Weimar Germany in A level history. My main question at the time was 'Did no one realise what was happening?' The answer is of course people did, but it was ignored by the leaders. By the time any action was taken it was too late.</p>

<p>Usually at the end of the year I write a little summary of what happened in the world at large. (<a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">2016</a>, <a href="">2017</a>, <a href="https://davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-in-review-a-poem/">2018</a>, <a href="https://davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-year-of-contradictions/">2019.</a>) This year I really struggled. How do you summarise what has happened this year, other than a absence? It's been terrible in so many ways. The pandemic has turned everything on it's head and thousands of people have died unnecessarily through our government's inaction. Let alone all the other problems that this virus has highlighted as deep rifts within our society.</p>

<p>We were meant to be children of the stars now, Richard thought to himself as he buttoned up his coat. Humans were meant to have escaped this lonely planet and headed out into the void. We were meant to be interplanetary trans dimensional demi-gods by now. Or so the stories and films promised us. Instead, we are all trapped on this dark planet, watching the chaos get worse. Every day, another headline about a corrupt politician or science gone wrong or children roaming the streets causing violence and destruction. It was getting worse by the day.</p>

<p><em>This a series where I interview poets about their process and writing in reference to a single poem. Today we have Damien Donnelly, who kindly invited me onto his podcast Eat the Storms in November. Listen to that <a href="https://eatthestorms.com/2020/11/14/eat-the-storms-the-podcast-episode-11/">here.</a> Today we reflect on the writing process of his Pushcart nominated poem,</em> Tattered Brown Trousers.</p>

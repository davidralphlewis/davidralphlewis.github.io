<p>Surrounded by the long grass swaying in the breeze, the office seemed forever away. Helen could hear the gentle babbling of a stream somewhere nearby. Far up in the sky, a bird of prey hovered, looking for dinner. She felt the warmth of the golden sun on her face. She needed this.</p>

<p>Miss Morris asked us to bring something special<br>
in and talk about it in front of the class<br>
for everyone else to share and enjoy<br>
and so in this cardboard box I have brought<br>
the first rays of morning and if I open it<br>
this classroom, with its peeling walls,<br>
its desks engraved with cramped insults<br>
and declarations of love from children<br>
who have now become adults, its blutacked<br>
posters of the alphabet, all we can see will<br>
transform into gold and all our eyes will<br>
glitter and all the dust in the spaces<br>
between us will dance and twirl in the light.</p>

<p>Were you the stranger dressed in electricity<br>
who floated above the tarmac without contact,<br>
who smiled in morse code, smelled of lavender<br>
and engine oil, who spoke in rapid static bursts<br>
which I understood to be secrets never spoken?<br>
Did you splinter my sternum, peer inside to find<br>
distant storms and lightning brewing? Did you fold<br>
yourself into the air and vanish, entering the unseen<br>
creases of reality as easily as catching a bus?<br>
Were your irises burnt into the pavement for days?<br>
Please respond to me if so, I have your wallet.</p>

<p>The opening shot is a still lake, first thing in the morning. The sun has just started to beam down on the water. It is a mirror, reflecting the perfect blue sky. There’s no clouds. Not here. The lake is surrounded by pine trees, all pristine as if they have been copy and pasted. There’s a pier that juts out from the bottom of the frame into the lake, with a small row boat tied to it. The boat has a cloth tarpaulin over it and oars sticking out.  A couple of boards are missing on the pier. Paint on the boat is peeling off. It only adds to the charm of the place. This is a place you feel calm and happy in. A place you’ve had recurring dreams about.</p>

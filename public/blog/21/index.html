<p>From her vantage point of the second highest branch, Cassie saw it first, growing over the horizon like a bruise. She often spent afternoons by herself in the garden, away from the noise of the house- The music pounding from her brother Jamie’s closed door, Sampson barking at nothing, the rumbling of the ancient boiler. Her parents constantly screaming at each other. Or worse, being polite through gritted teeth. Cassie preferred the relative silence of the garden. Birds might chirrup at each other, but it never sounded angry. For most of the Easter holidays, she had got into the habit of marching out in the morning, her current book under her arm, with cheese and tomato sandwiches and lemonade in her backpack, plus another book just in case the first ran out. Suggestions of family days out and trips to places had been stubbornly resisted. She didn’t want to hang around her loser family at all, even if it meant going to a cool castle.</p>

<p>You may notice my website looks a little different. I have moved it from Wordpress to Jekyll, teaching myself rudimentary HTML and CSS in the process. I changed a template by <a href="https://github.com/dpstrange/jekyll-bootstrap">DpStrange</a>, modifying it to fit my needs. I also transferred all 278 (!) blog posts over. I honestly hadn't realised I'd done so many, but then I've been working at this blogging game for the last four years. I'm pleased with the results, but it you see a problem or coding issue please let me know.</p>

<p>What good is this scattering over the grass,<br>
this gold and white confetti, these eyes<br>
opening at dawn and closing in the twilight?<br>
These are Freya's flowers and she is welcome<br>
to them. We have no use for blooms. Callous gods,<br>
you cannot substitute one beauty for another.<br>
What help is protection now? Your garlands<br>
are mere distractions, we have no desire<br>
to chew on the pollen, fill our mouths<br>
with bitter medicine. Left long enough<br>
the petals blister our skin, we become<br>
sun scaled. Spread them no more, perpetual<br>
reminders of our sorrows that raise their<br>
heads above the green then proliferate<br>
over the fields. They will never bring<br>
back those who have sunk below, those now<br>
cradled by the waiting arms of roots.</p>

<p><a href="http://facebook.com/echoesandedges">Echoes and edges</a> were kind enough to set my poem <em>How to hear the hills</em> to an incredible deep soundtrack as part of their live stream collaboration. You can <a href="https://youtu.be/RL3WjakLW8Y">watch it here.</a></p>

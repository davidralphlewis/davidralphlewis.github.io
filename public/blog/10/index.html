<p>I draw a square, to represent a former tobacco warehouse,<br>
converted by the council into offices, where I worked<br>
for a charity. On my desk, a spider plant strained<br>
towards the distant, narrow window. In pencil I sketch<br>
two parallel lines to scale to show the road I would walk<br>
every day, listening to podcasts I now can't remember,<br>
past the tower blocks being torn down to make way for unaffordable flats,<br>
past all the independent boutiques selling so many<br>
house plants and minimalist vases that used to be trendy<br>
to the flat I lived in for three years. I huddle together rectangles<br>
to show a house in Bedminster, wedged in-between Poundland,<br>
the cash for gold shops and refurbished pubs that served<br>
craft beer for six pounds a pint. I cannot show how<br>
we grew our lives around the skylights, listened to the same<br>
three karaoke songs drifting in from The Tap and Barrel<br>
four doors down and huddled around a scratched<br>
second hand IKEA table when it came time to work from home.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2021-08-19-Art-is-play/">Art as Play</a> </h2>

<p>I've spent a lot of this year consciously learning what was previously unconscious. I lost faith in my writing, so I took a lot of workshops and attempted to figure out exactly what I am doing. For about five years, I've been writing poetry and still feel a certain level of imposter syndrome, not really knowing what I am doing. Taking workshops has been an attempt to relearn what I already know on some level, while also attempting to implement the rules of poetry so I can do it 'properly' (whatever that means.)</p>

<p>It starts with a whisper,<br>
muttered half phrases<br>
and small slanders shaking<br>
leaves, pushing wind chimes<br>
into gentle collisions.</p>

<p>In another example of running a controversial story to get clicks, the Huffington Post published an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-gough/selfpublishing-an-insult-_b_13606682.html">article</a> by Laurie Gough that argues that self-publishing is an insult to the written word. (Of course, they also published <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samita-sarkar/selfpublishing-an-insult-_1_b_13903202.html">a reaction</a> to the original article, so they have it both ways.) As a self-published author myself, I disagree with Laurie's argument. There has been a few angry responses to this opinion piece, but I thought I'd offer some personal thoughts on why I take issue with it.</p>

<p>2016 was a curious year. Politics <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">ate </a><a href="what-does-it-matter/">itself</a> and <a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">the internet </a>took over all discourse. But personally, it was pretty good. I published two books, one a collection of <a href="/amberstars/">short stories </a>and one <a href="/remain-vigilant/">playscript</a>. I wrote this blog every week, made a website and got in the habit of producing things regularly. I went to Skye for a long week and went to loads of gigs. It's odd having this dichotomy between the terrible news of politics and the quite good personal life.</p>

<p>What a year. It started with David Bowie dying and somehow went downhill from there. <a href="/brexit-and-the-story-we-have-been-told/">A rabid </a>media stirring up <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">hate</a> forced the British people to shoot themselves in the foot, whilst in the USA hate and intolerance won the day- ifÂ not the popular vote.</p>

<p>On a long coach journey back from Leeds a couple of weekends ago, I listened to Chris Gethard's podcast <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/">Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People</a>. I was recommended the podcast by Mel and it's become a firm favourite. Each person calls into the program and has an hour to speak about whatever they want before the call hangs up. The only rule is that it needs to be anonymous, hence the title. It's well worth listening to. Chris Gethard is a natural host, encouraging conversations to go in different directions and allowing the caller to speak. It's also fascinating to hear the opinions and stories of ordinary people, as we are too obsessed with celebrities.</p>

<p>Now the nights are drawing in and daylight is a distant memory. We surrender ourselves to the dark and cold, waiting and hibernating until spring.</p>

<p>Last week, I published a new ebook. Called <a href="/remain-vigilant/"><em>Remain Vigilant</em>,</a> it consists of two linked one act plays set in the same fictional government agency that deals with surveillance. I actually wrote it over eighteen months ago, left it on my hard drive and forgot about it. My background is in playwriting, so this was before I got into writing short stories and other pieces.</p>

<p>Science fiction is an escape from our mundane reality to another shinier, brighter alternate world. There's a whole universe of unusual aliens to discover. It reflects the times it was written and what the hopes were, or extrapolates based on available data. As well as providing an escape, it can also show us a way forward at the moment.. We go halfway around the universe only to discover ourselves.</p>

<p>In the shock generated in the wake of the US election, one refrain I keep hearing from people was what does it matter to us? Sure, people feel bad for the USA and all, but we have our own problems to deal with. I can sympathise with this view. The UK is a scary enough place at the moment, what with Brexit, the rise of hate crimes and confusion that has followed in its wake. However, I feel like the rest of the world needs to be concerned about the election of Donald Trump.<br>

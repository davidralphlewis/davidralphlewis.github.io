<p>In the shock generated in the wake of the US election, one refrain I keep hearing from people was what does it matter to us? Sure, people feel bad for the USA and all, but we have our own problems to deal with. I can sympathise with this view. The UK is a scary enough place at the moment, what with Brexit, the rise of hate crimes and confusion that has followed in its wake. However, I feel like the rest of the world needs to be concerned about the election of Donald Trump.<br>
Here's why:</p>

<p>Summer is a distant memory now. We huddle around the fire for warmth and watch the leaves slowly drift to the ground. It's chilly outside. Best to draw up the blankets around you, grab a hot drink and hibernate for the winter. Here are a few links to keep you going</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-11-02T00:00:00.000Z">November 2, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>One of the most important changes I have implemented in the last couple of years has been a creative routine. I find it helpful to work regularly towards a goal, writing every day instead of waiting for inspiration to strike. Showing up whether I feel like it or not. When I was writing <a href="/amber-stars/">Amber Stars: One Night of Stories</a>, I woke up at six every weekday, wrote for 45 minutes then got on with the rest of my day. I've kept it going since and have drafted several short stories, a play and a novella in the past months. A regular time to write, while the world is quiet, has been immensely helpful for getting the words written.</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z">October 28, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>I finally got round to listening to the new Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds album <em>Skeleton Tree</em>. It is an incredible listen, but also quite harrowing. After twenty-three years as a band and sixteen studio releases, the music still manages to sound fresh and different. Warren Ellis' sparse but haunting instrumentation adds a strange melancholy air to the proceedings. I've listened a few times now and I think it might be one of my favourite albums by the band. But also, I don't plan on listening to it too much.</p>

<p>Oh boy. If ever there was a book that was designed to make you furious about the current state of the world, this is it. Although <em>The Shock Doctrine</em> was published in 2007, Naomi Klein's insight into the conservative mindset still remains sadly relevant to the world today.</p>

<p>So I was going to write about something else entirely, but then the I stumbled on <em>The Daily Mail</em> on Twitter. I try to avoid it when I can because it is always a hate-filled rag, but I couldn't avoid it. Today it published this front page:</p>

<p>Summer has flown away, the trees are turning and autumn has hit with a punch overnight. All of a sudden it's a bit grim outside and we hunker down, gather straw around us and hibernate until winter. Ah well, here's some things that I enjoyed in September, and you might too:</p>

<p>When I was a teenager, I wrote poetry. Well, maybe that's the wrong word. It was half-baked doggerel chopped up into lines that showed how really angsty I was, man, and how no one understood me. You know. Teenage stuff. I scrawled in notebooks, filling endless pages with such nonsense.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-09-14-the-ambiguity-of-captain-fantastic/">The Ambiguity of Captain Fantastic</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-09-14T00:00:00.000Z">September 14, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p><em>Captain Fantastic</em> is a brilliant film. Sensitive and compassionate, it tells the story of a family isolated from society, who are forced to go cross country to attend their mother's funeral. In doing so, they have to enter mainstream society for the first time. It is remarkably beautiful, with an excellent script and nuanced performances, especially from the children and Viggo Mortensen as Ben.</p>

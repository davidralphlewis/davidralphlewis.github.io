<p>Now the nights are drawing in and daylight is a distant memory. We surrender ourselves to the dark and cold, waiting and hibernating until spring.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-11-29-surveillance-the-investigatory-powers-bill-and-remain-vigilant/">Surveillance, the Investigatory Powers Bill and Remain Vigilant</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z">November 29, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>Last week, I published a new ebook. Called <a href="/remain-vigilant/"><em>Remain Vigilant</em>,</a> it consists of two linked one act plays set in the same fictional government agency that deals with surveillance. I actually wrote it over eighteen months ago, left it on my hard drive and forgot about it. My background is in playwriting, so this was before I got into writing short stories and other pieces.</p>

<p>Science fiction is an escape from our mundane reality to another shinier, brighter alternate world. There's a whole universe of unusual aliens to discover. It reflects the times it was written and what the hopes were, or extrapolates based on available data. As well as providing an escape, it can also show us a way forward at the moment.. We go halfway around the universe only to discover ourselves.</p>

<p>In the shock generated in the wake of the US election, one refrain I keep hearing from people was what does it matter to us? Sure, people feel bad for the USA and all, but we have our own problems to deal with. I can sympathise with this view. The UK is a scary enough place at the moment, what with Brexit, the rise of hate crimes and confusion that has followed in its wake. However, I feel like the rest of the world needs to be concerned about the election of Donald Trump.<br>
Here's why:</p>

<p>Summer is a distant memory now. We huddle around the fire for warmth and watch the leaves slowly drift to the ground. It's chilly outside. Best to draw up the blankets around you, grab a hot drink and hibernate for the winter. Here are a few links to keep you going</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-11-02-the-importance-of-a-creative-routine/">The importance of a creative routine</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-11-02T00:00:00.000Z">November 2, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>One of the most important changes I have implemented in the last couple of years has been a creative routine. I find it helpful to work regularly towards a goal, writing every day instead of waiting for inspiration to strike. Showing up whether I feel like it or not. When I was writing <a href="/amber-stars/">Amber Stars: One Night of Stories</a>, I woke up at six every weekday, wrote for 45 minutes then got on with the rest of my day. I've kept it going since and have drafted several short stories, a play and a novella in the past months. A regular time to write, while the world is quiet, has been immensely helpful for getting the words written.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-10-28-nick-cave-and-music-that-is-too-difficult-to-listen-to/">Nick Cave and music that is too difficult to listen to</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z">October 28, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>I finally got round to listening to the new Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds album <em>Skeleton Tree</em>. It is an incredible listen, but also quite harrowing. After twenty-three years as a band and sixteen studio releases, the music still manages to sound fresh and different. Warren Ellis' sparse but haunting instrumentation adds a strange melancholy air to the proceedings. I've listened a few times now and I think it might be one of my favourite albums by the band. But also, I don't plan on listening to it too much.</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-10-19T00:00:00.000Z">October 19, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>Oh boy. If ever there was a book that was designed to make you furious about the current state of the world, this is it. Although <em>The Shock Doctrine</em> was published in 2007, Naomi Klein's insight into the conservative mindset still remains sadly relevant to the world today.</p>

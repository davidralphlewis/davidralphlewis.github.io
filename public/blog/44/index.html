<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-18-a-press-conference/">A Press Conference</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-18T00:00:00.000Z">January 18, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I am here today to announce there is nothing wrong. Nothing at all. Everything is fine. Rumours you may have heard to the contrary are simply that- rumours. Do not worry in the slightest. Do not worry about the Shadowlands. They do not exist because everything is fine.</p>

<p>I was listening to the rather excellent <a href="http://cosmicgenome.com/shambles/">Book Shambles </a>podcast the other day. It is a rambling discussion about books and literature, usually with a guest to guide the discussion. One of the hosts, Robin Ince, mentioned <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, saying that every time he reads it he finds new insight in its pages. It's my experience that despite being a relatively slim novella, the complex characters and removed perspective provides a wealth of wisdom and observations. It got me thinking about art that endures throughout your life, that helps to shape you at different moments. I think this is one of the qualities of the best art, that each time you go back to it it is richer and more in-depth than before. Re-readings and re-watchings allow for greater emotional impact, instead of diminishing returns. The art endures throughout your life.</p>

<p>In another example of running a controversial story to get clicks, the Huffington Post published an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-gough/selfpublishing-an-insult-_b_13606682.html">article</a> by Laurie Gough that argues that self-publishing is an insult to the written word. (Of course, they also published <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samita-sarkar/selfpublishing-an-insult-_1_b_13903202.html">a reaction</a> to the original article, so they have it both ways.) As a self-published author myself, I disagree with Laurie's argument. There has been a few angry responses to this opinion piece, but I thought I'd offer some personal thoughts on why I take issue with it.</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-12-29T00:00:00.000Z">December 29, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>2016 was a curious year. Politics <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">ate </a><a href="what-does-it-matter/">itself</a> and <a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">the internet </a>took over all discourse. But personally, it was pretty good. I published two books, one a collection of <a href="/amberstars/">short stories </a>and one <a href="/remain-vigilant/">playscript</a>. I wrote this blog every week, made a website and got in the habit of producing things regularly. I went to Skye for a long week and went to loads of gigs. It's odd having this dichotomy between the terrible news of politics and the quite good personal life.</p>

<p>What a year. It started with David Bowie dying and somehow went downhill from there. <a href="/brexit-and-the-story-we-have-been-told/">A rabid </a>media stirring up <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">hate</a> forced the British people to shoot themselves in the foot, whilst in the USA hate and intolerance won the day- ifÂ not the popular vote.</p>

<p>On a long coach journey back from Leeds a couple of weekends ago, I listened to Chris Gethard's podcast <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/">Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People</a>. I was recommended the podcast by Mel and it's become a firm favourite. Each person calls into the program and has an hour to speak about whatever they want before the call hangs up. The only rule is that it needs to be anonymous, hence the title. It's well worth listening to. Chris Gethard is a natural host, encouraging conversations to go in different directions and allowing the caller to speak. It's also fascinating to hear the opinions and stories of ordinary people, as we are too obsessed with celebrities.</p>

<p>Now the nights are drawing in and daylight is a distant memory. We surrender ourselves to the dark and cold, waiting and hibernating until spring.</p>

<p>Hello</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-11-29-surveillance-the-investigatory-powers-bill-and-remain-vigilant/">Surveillance, the Investigatory Powers Bill and Remain Vigilant</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-11-29T00:00:00.000Z">November 29, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>Last week, I published a new ebook. Called <a href="/remain-vigilant/"><em>Remain Vigilant</em>,</a> it consists of two linked one act plays set in the same fictional government agency that deals with surveillance. I actually wrote it over eighteen months ago, left it on my hard drive and forgot about it. My background is in playwriting, so this was before I got into writing short stories and other pieces.</p>

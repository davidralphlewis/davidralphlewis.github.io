<p>Much like I did last year, I thought I'd take some time to linger on what I enjoyed this year. I've already written up my thoughts on <a href="/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/">the terrible events in politics</a>. This will be much more positive.<!--more--></p>

<p>So the year isn't technically over yet. There's still a good couple of weeks for things to go completely south. I'm travelling first thing next year so I thought I'd get my year in review in early.</p>

<p>Hello? This is Frank. I came in yesterday to pick up the keys for flat 65. OK? I don't see why you have to look it up on the computer, it was only yesterday. I didn't speak to one of your colleagues, no, I spoke to you. I remember you. Blonde hair. You were doing your nails. I came by about 3 pm?</p>

<p>It's been a while, hasn't it? How are you? Are you still doing that thing with them and everything else? Oh really? Good to hear.</p>

<p>I'm currently in the business of moving across the country. I'm packing up my whole life into boxes. Every time I move I forget how all consuming and stressful it is. Foolishly, I thought I could carry on writing this blog whilst I was moving. Clearly, I was wrong. I've had no time to write at all. Life has got in the way.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-07-05-glastonbury-festival-thoughts/">Suspend the outside world for a while: Thoughts on Glastonbury Festival</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-07-05T00:00:00.000Z">July 5, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Posts on this blog have been a bit scarce for the last couple of weeks, mostly because I spent a several days in a field in Somerset. I listened to music, watched comedy and saw the odd <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/24/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-unity-in-glastonbury-speech">politician</a>. [^1] I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/">Glastonbury Festival</a>, a cornucopia of delights that I have gone to since I was fifteen.  This was my seventh time at the festival. I have been to others in the meantime, but it remains the original and the best. It is a marvellous tent town where the outside world is put on hold for a while, where the normal rules no longer apply and where art and hope rules above everything else.  I thought I'd write about why it remains so special to me and many others.</p>

<p>So there's an election on Thursday. You might have heard of it. You probably have your own opinions one way or another. Maybe you don't care. But either way, you have to admit, it is kind of a big deal.</p>

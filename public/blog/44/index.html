<p>I'm doing this again. Last year I quite enjoyed the process of creating a brand new poem every day in April so have decided to do it again.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-03-25-not-writing-enough/">Creative Anxieties: Fear of not writing enough</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z">March 25, 2018</time><br/></i>
<div>This blog post is late. I was meant to write it last week, but life got it the way, as it always seems to do. It's not just this week's though; the self-imposed schedule I imposed at the start of the year has slowly slipped away. This, inevitably, leads to guilt and worry. More specifically, I always feel like I'm not writing enough. I need to produce more. When I do write, it never feels like enough.</div>  
<!--more-->  
<p>It's not just me though. Have a look at this thread from Rebecca Williams about the constant guilt and pressure she feels to continue writing:</p>

<i><time datetime="2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z">February 28, 2018</time><br/></i>
<p>There's a certain kind of article you stumble across now and then which consists of important things people have learnt about life. Usually these are linked to a milestone age, like 50, or 10,000 days on Earth. Lists of advice that seems wise and sage and the accumulation of years of study. This is not one of those articles.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-01-24-advice-writing-resolutions/">Advice to Myself: Writing and Resolutions</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2018-01-24T00:00:00.000Z">January 24, 2018</time><br/></i>
<p>At the start of the year, we tend to set goals and resolutions. This year is going to be the year I start eating healthy, the year I finally learn guitar or the year I start running. Then, inevitably, around this time every year, most of the resolutions are discarded or broken. Maybe they never even started.</p>

<i><time datetime="2017-12-26T00:00:00.000Z">December 26, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Much like I did last year, I thought I'd take some time to linger on what I enjoyed this year. I've already written up my thoughts on <a href="/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/">the terrible events in politics</a>. This will be much more positive.<!--more--></p>

<i><time datetime="2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z">December 12, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>So the year isn't technically over yet. There's still a good couple of weeks for things to go completely south. I'm travelling first thing next year so I thought I'd get my year in review in early.</p>

<p>Hello? This is Frank. I came in yesterday to pick up the keys for flat 65. OK? I don't see why you have to look it up on the computer, it was only yesterday. I didn't speak to one of your colleagues, no, I spoke to you. I remember you. Blonde hair. You were doing your nails. I came by about 3 pm?</p>

<p>It's been a while, hasn't it? How are you? Are you still doing that thing with them and everything else? Oh really? Good to hear.</p>

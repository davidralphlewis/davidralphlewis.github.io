<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-07-05-glastonbury-festival-thoughts/">Suspend the outside world for a while: Thoughts on Glastonbury Festival</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-07-05T00:00:00.000Z">July 5, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Posts on this blog have been a bit scarce for the last couple of weeks, mostly because I spent a several days in a field in Somerset. I listened to music, watched comedy and saw the odd <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/24/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-unity-in-glastonbury-speech">politician</a>. [^1] I was lucky enough to attend <a href="http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/">Glastonbury Festival</a>, a cornucopia of delights that I have gone to since I was fifteen.  This was my seventh time at the festival. I have been to others in the meantime, but it remains the original and the best. It is a marvellous tent town where the outside world is put on hold for a while, where the normal rules no longer apply and where art and hope rules above everything else.  I thought I'd write about why it remains so special to me and many others.</p>

<p>So there's an election on Thursday. You might have heard of it. You probably have your own opinions one way or another. Maybe you don't care. But either way, you have to admit, it is kind of a big deal.</p>

<p><strong>KATIE NEWSINGTON</strong>: Welcome back. A new study suggests the moon has a more abundant mineral content than previously realised. Interesting stuff. Joining us to discuss some important questions is the author of the study, Professor Ian Boffin.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-05-10-everything-is-a-story/">Everything is a story</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z">May 10, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>One of the things reading a lot of fiction teaches you is that everything we rely on in the real world is made up. We are narrative beings and we rely on the power of stories to guide our everyday lives. Very little of our experiences and the systems we live in are based on cold facts. Most of the stories we tell ourselves do no have neat structures, with a beginning, a middle and an end, but are beliefs we hold that change how we view the world.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-05-03-final-thoughts-napowrimo/">At the End of NaPoWriMo</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-05-03T00:00:00.000Z">May 3, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I wrote a bit about the process <a href="/napowrimo-halfway-through/">halfway through</a>, but I've finally finished <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a>, where you write a poem every single day in April. I had foolishly thought the process would be relatively straightforward, but I was drastically wrong about that. Writing so many lines over so many days was a real challenge. It was difficult to keep motivated and continue writing.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-04-26-jerusalem-ambition-power-of-ideas/">Jerusalem, Ambition and the Power of Ideas</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z">April 26, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>It's taken me three and a half months, but I finally finished Alan Moore's magnum opus <em>Jerusalem</em>.  Made of a number of interlinked short stories set in Northampton, it tells the history of the town as well as the nature of life, death and time itself. It is ridiculously broad in its scope while remaining funny and down to earth, with a serious message about the abuse of the working class. The entire second book occurs whilst a child is choking on a sweet. Each chapter, especially in the last book, uses its own style. There's an epic poem, a play, a Joycean wordplay chapter. In short, it is a hugely ambitious work that in my opinion succeeds wholeheartedly.</p>

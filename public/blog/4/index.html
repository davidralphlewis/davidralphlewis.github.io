<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-07-17-May-and-June-2023-Input/">May and June 2023 Input</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-07-17T00:00:00.000Z">July 17, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>This is slightly late as I've thrown myself back into the world after a halting start to the year. I joined a gym, started going to more things and exploring the new area we live in. I also went to Birmingham and other places around the country a bit more.</p>

<p>I define myself by edges--my skin,<br>
car bonnets- but I am oh so permeable.<br>
Chest matching thumpthumpthump of potholes.<br>
Clemency lies between radio stations,<br>
in the pause before windshield wipers<br>
swish back to starting positions.<br>
Hands tapping morse on the steering wheel,<br>
messages to distant and unseen agents.<br>
My party trick is dissolving into vapour.<br>
Rumble strips and cat's eyes broadcast:<br>
&quot;Forget all you know. Unlearn your old self.<br>
A new world is forming in articulated lorry spray.<br>
Rewild your petty dreams and ambitions.&quot;<br>
Infusing clouds reach swirling fingers<br>
to stroke my embossed flesh, damp comfort.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/">On Threads</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-07-07T00:00:00.000Z">July 7, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>By now you would have seen there's a new social network in town. Threads is a Twitter alternative made by Meta[^1] and closely linked with Instagram. I signed up out of curiosity and almost immediately regretted it.</p>

<p>They sometimes shine torches over the strata<br>
of compressed time, with sweeping, shaking<br>
hands. Eternity is present in their half smiles.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-06-22-On-Submissions/">Personal Thoughts on Submissions</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-06-22T00:00:00.000Z">June 22, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>I've spent a lot of this year purposely retreating from my typical ways of writing, to try and reinvent my practise. As such I made a conscious decision not to submit to literary journals or competitions this year. While previously I have had some moderate success, I found I was basing too much of my perception of my writing on how it was received.</p>

<p>Here, under the glitter of a multi-coloured canopy I am finding a new serenity, the peace of lives measured in centuries. I am removed from glaring lights and constant haze, breathing in a million micro-organisms. My pulse no longer has the twitch and shuffle of muffled drum and bass bleeding through the wall from next door, my heartbeat settles to the pace of my slow stride. I have left behind the disarray of the city, exchanged it for the slow drowning of moss. I am stopping walking, gazing up at the branches and the distant sun, falling faster. Recently I have been too much concerned with electrical misfires inside my head, I have forgotten to watch lichen climb a felled trunk. My toes are rooting into the soil. They are sending signals into the mycellium network. It responds with a sustained hum. This long note holds me captive. I breathe out poison, nutrients for the leaves encircling me. We sway in symbiosis. My legs bend together. Merge. Time is syrup. Here is stillness. My pulse is. Slowing. To a beat. per minute. Hour. Days dropping. Dead leaves. Pile. Mulch. Regrow. My skin now. brittle. Wrinkled. Bark. What was. My name? I am. reaching. Arms. Twigs. Arms. Branches. To sky. My smile. Frozen. My blood. sap. I reach. Up. Decades. Collapse. Sky. Branches. Reach. towards. Light. Light. Light. Light.</p>

<p>Down the central reservation he strode,<br>
unbothered by exhaust fumes or concrete,
face encased in a leather mask.</p>

<p>Overnight, loam has been churned.<br>
A fresh furrowed field before me.<br>
footpath now forgotten, land lost<br>
thanks to vast machines that chew<br>
and crunch, split fresh green shock<br>
into parallel mounds of uniform brown.</p>

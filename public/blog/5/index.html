<p>Somewhere, possibly close, the kettle boils.<br>
I am waiting for my insides to knit together<br>
around an absence, watching petals a shade<br>
off clouds emerge on phalanx thin branches.</p>
</p>

<p>It's Easter and all the daffodils are screaming<br>
at the awakening ground- &quot;Lazy arsehole!&quot;<br>
&quot;Good for nothing useless compost!&quot;<br>
Rhubarb cracks fresh bones as it stretches<br>
towards a terracotta sky, body on new body.<br>
The stillness you found among roadkill<br>
and in the cold and muddy verges<br>
has been shattered by sudden ferns.<br>
We have read the skies like scripture.<br>
Now is the time to live- breathless, unforgiving.<br>
I hold my unnoticed, selfish serenity close,<br>
feel it crack open, send out exploratory shoots,<br>
mutate into this fragile yellow dream.</p>

<p>For the first couple of weeks in March I was recovering from gallbladder surgery, so had a lot of time to read and reflect and watch things as I let my body knit itself together. (I'm back to full health now.) As a result, it's been quite a rich month, with lots to recommend. Here's what I read and consumed in March:</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-04-10-Fever/">Fever</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-04-10T00:00:00.000Z">April 10, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>I woke up in a thousand different realities<br>
simultaneously, head stuffed with cloves/<br>
industrial by-products and waste/<br>
a single sustained tinnitus buzz.</p>

<p>and yes, I still gathered branches,<br>
and yes, I still wore my woollen coat,<br>
but it was unbuttoned, no scarf</p>

<p>I've been meaning to do this for a couple of months, but during that time Christmas has come and gone, then I've packed to move house, moved to the countryside and prepped for minor surgery. So no wonder I haven't had time to put thoughts to paper. I'm settled into our country house now and the quiet is welcome. This is what I've put into my brain from December 2022 to the end of February 2023.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-03-08-Lights/">Lights</a> </h2>

<p>The sky and each moment expands<br>
as I observe it. I've forgotten the season<br>
but the single layer of skin on my fingers<br>
remembers. I am an uncertain brittle being,<br>
standing under the galaxy, watching your sighs<br>
form the briefest of clouds. A distant owl calls.<br>
I'm not prey, not tonight.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-02-03-Fly-Away/">Fly Away</a> </h2>

<p>I am hauling all our rugs, books,<br>
house plants, our glasses wrapped<br>
in bubble wrap and old duvets ,<br>
all our memories neatly boxed up,<br>
every object we own all jumbled,<br>
carrying from the borrowed van<br>
into our new home. I am bending<br>
at the knees. I am judging the structural<br>
stability of cardboard to ensure<br>
our horde will stack. Tessellation<br>
is essential. My shoulders radiate<br>
like embers. Your nerves are glowing<br>
filaments of thin tungsten.</p>

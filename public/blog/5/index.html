<p>For the first couple of weeks in March I was recovering from gallbladder surgery, so had a lot of time to read and reflect and watch things as I let my body knit itself together. (I'm back to full health now.) As a result, it's been quite a rich month, with lots to recommend. Here's what I read and consumed in March:</p>

<p>I woke up in a thousand different realities<br>
simultaneously, head stuffed with cloves/<br>
industrial by-products and waste/<br>
a single sustained tinnitus buzz.</p>

<p>and yes, I still gathered branches,<br>
and yes, I still wore my woollen coat,<br>
but it was unbuttoned, no scarf</p>

<p>I've been meaning to do this for a couple of months, but during that time Christmas has come and gone, then I've packed to move house, moved to the countryside and prepped for minor surgery. So no wonder I haven't had time to put thoughts to paper. I'm settled into our country house now and the quiet is welcome. This is what I've put into my brain from December 2022 to the end of February 2023.</p>

<p>The sky and each moment expands<br>
as I observe it. I've forgotten the season<br>
but the single layer of skin on my fingers<br>
remembers. I am an uncertain brittle being,<br>
standing under the galaxy, watching your sighs<br>
form the briefest of clouds. A distant owl calls.<br>
I'm not prey, not tonight.</p>

<p>I am hauling all our rugs, books,<br>
house plants, our glasses wrapped<br>
in bubble wrap and old duvets ,<br>
all our memories neatly boxed up,<br>
every object we own all jumbled,<br>
carrying from the borrowed van<br>
into our new home. I am bending<br>
at the knees. I am judging the structural<br>
stability of cardboard to ensure<br>
our horde will stack. Tessellation<br>
is essential. My shoulders radiate<br>
like embers. Your nerves are glowing<br>
filaments of thin tungsten.</p>

<p>I maintained the gears of the moon as a university job. On my empty days, I polished the levers, tightened the cranks and ensured there was enough oil to guarantee a smooth rise. At night, the company had a whole team on standby for the show, but during the day I was left alone with the machinery, inside a vast and echoing warehouse. My jobs did not take very long. I was a glorified security guard. Most of my shift passed in the staff room, deep under the surface, surrounded by the whirr and sigh of complex systems I could barely understand. I ate my tuna sandwiches, read terrible sci-fi novels, listened to music on my half broken walkman held together by duct tape and watched money for my studies crawl up in a ticker inside my head.</p>

<p>Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
morning shudders, barely starts<br>
Our fallow fields now writhe with blight.<br>
Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
We have lost colour from our sight-<br>
like fools, we hold hope in our hearts.<br>
Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
morning shudders, barely starts.</p>

<p>I'm just back from a week in Scotland. I spent a couple of days at the Edinburgh Fringe, then onto the incredibly beautiful Isle of Skye.Then back to Edinburgh for a night. It was an excellent trip, filled with delight.</p>

<p>I've been really busy this month with all good things. I went to three music festivals, canoed down the Thames and generally had lots of good times.. But in between playing Pokemon Go, there's been a few articles and things that are worth reading:</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-07-27-just-walk-away/">Just Walk Away: On Cynicism and Subjectivity</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-07-27T00:00:00.000Z">July 27, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>I was at Tramlines music festival in Sheffield at the weekend. There was sunshine, there was music, there was booze. Lots of good times were had. One of the bands I was most looking forward to seeing was Public Service Broadcasting, who did not disappoint.</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-07-20T00:00:00.000Z">July 20, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>Free speech is hard, especially on the internet. You should have the ability to say almost anything without fear of legal repercussion. Other than words that actively harm people, like shouting fire in a crowded room, or death threats, you should be able to say any stupid stuff you like. The beauty of free speech is that if you say something objectionable or offensive, people can argue with you and say you were out of line.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-07-12-ponyo-and-adaptation/">Ponyo and Adaptation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-07-12T00:00:00.000Z">July 12, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p><em>Ponyo</em> is a joyous film, a celebration of childhood and youth with beautiful visuals. It's pure joy from start to finish, with inventive twists and a unique style. Generally, Studio Ghibli films are among some of my favourites because of the rambling yet emotional stories that feel very different to any other film. This film is no exception, with a wide ranging plot involving prehistoric fish and mysterious spirits of the sea.</p>

<i><time datetime="2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z">July 4, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>I've finished reading <em>Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction</em> by Jeff Vandermeer. It's a great read, full of useful information and exercises. Mostly, it is a nuts and bolts guide to stories and their various elements, characters, plotting, but the way it presented and the advice it gives about the imagination make it truly unique.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this for <a href="http://moreincommon.tumblr.com/">More in Common</a> from the Royal Court, which is well worth checking out. It was written fairly quickly so it's not perfect.</em></p>

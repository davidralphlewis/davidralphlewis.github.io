<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-04-21-the-cement-garden-by-ian-mcewan-book-review/">The Cement Garden by Ian McEwan- Book Review</a> </h2>

<p>I picked this short novella up recently and devoured it in about a day. Having previously read some of Ian McEwan's later novels such as <em>Saturday</em> and <em>On Chesil Beach</em>, I wasn't expecting such a violent and horrible little story. It deals with four children left abandoned in their house when both their parents die, and the unpleasantness that follows their isolation.</p>

<p>After I published my first book of short stories, <em><a href="/amberstars/">Amber Stars</a></em>, I took a week off writing. I enjoyed the achievement of actually finishing a project and publishing a book. So I kicked back, read some books, browsed the web a lot and created absolutely nothing.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-04-12-newspaper-blackout-poems/">Newspaper Blackout Poems</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-04-12T00:00:00.000Z">April 12, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>In the past month, I've been messing around with a strange form of 'writing' called blackout poems. I was inspired by <a href="http://austinkleon.com/newspaperblackout/">Austin Kleon</a>, who helped popularise the form. Since then, hundreds of people have ran with it, creating new and different poetry using existing texts.</p>

<p>The live music experience is still thriving, even as CD sales fall. For many bands, it is the primary way of making a living. It seems odd that even as we devalue recorded music, live music has stayed important. I believe it comes down to the experience.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-04-04-thoughts-on-high-rise/">Thoughts on 'High Rise'</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-04-04T00:00:00.000Z">April 4, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>Last Saturday, somewhat spontaneously, I went to see <em>High Rise,</em> the newest film by Ben Wheatley. I'd previously seen <em>Sightseers</em> and <em>A Field in England</em> and enjoyed them both. The later wasn't wholly successful, but it felt very different to any other film I'd seen before.</p>

<p>Last Good Friday, I found myself hunched over the computer, fiddling with styles and formatting while outside was bright sunshine. It was all in aid of getting my first collection of short stories published, <em>Amber Stars</em>.</p>

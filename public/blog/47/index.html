<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-03-01-hope-in-the-dark-is-more-relevant-than-ever/">'Hope in the Dark' is more relevant than ever</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z">March 1, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>If you are a woolly liberal like me, someone who believes in compassion for all and the importance of civil liberties, then these are dark times. The prevalent mood, both in the UK and the USA appears to be an inward turning nationalism, a conservative rhetoric that is looking backwards to some imagined age rather than forward to the future. There's an emphasis on military spending and reducing the state. The hard-won luxuries we enjoy, such as the NHS, are continually being eroded, while at the same time the super rich refuse to pay any more tax. The gap between the rich and poor is growing. Trump is in the White House, whereas in the UK we have the authoritarian Theresa May hell bent on sending the country over a cliff. It's easy to despair and hard to see any hope.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-02-08-george-saunders-and-normalisation/">George Saunders and Normalisation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z">February 8, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>In these days of increasing insanity in the world of politics, I find myself thinking more and more about the fiction of George Saunders. He understands that humans will adapt to any situation, however bizarre and will build their identities around it, even if that situation is horrifying. Many of his characters rebel against the situations, or come to the realisation that, like Brexit or Trump, this is not normal. Since I read <em>Tenth of December</em> last year, the beautifully crafted short stories have become more and more relevant to the modern age. We seem to be living the surreal sci-fi world that Saunders created.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-02-02-step-away-from-the-internet/">Step Away from the Internet</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-02-02T00:00:00.000Z">February 2, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Every few months or so, an article comes around that reminds me I'm spending too much time on the internet, looking at pointless things and wasting time. This time, it was <a href="https://backchannel.com/how-i-got-my-attention-back-c7fc9297d347#.ggm3ob4j1">this</a> article by Craig Mod that caught my attention. It made me realise that I was once again endlessly flicking between the same sites, watching <a href="http://twitter.com/davidralphlewis">Twitter</a> refresh and reading the same articles over and over. It was an eloquently argued wake-up call.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-25-alternative-facts/">Alternative facts and the rule of misinformation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-25T00:00:00.000Z">January 25, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Bloody hell, what a terrible phrase 'Alternative facts' is. Similar to last years '<a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">post-truth</a>' that the UK media were so fond of last year, it seems the Americans are catching up to the Orwellian double-speak where 2+2 is 5 and nothing is as it seems.</p>

<p>I am here today to announce there is nothing wrong. Nothing at all. Everything is fine. Rumours you may have heard to the contrary are simply that- rumours. Do not worry in the slightest. Do not worry about the Shadowlands. They do not exist because everything is fine.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-10-enduring-art-same-as-it-ever-was/">Enduring art (Same as it ever was)</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z">January 10, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I was listening to the rather excellent <a href="http://cosmicgenome.com/shambles/">Book Shambles </a>podcast the other day. It is a rambling discussion about books and literature, usually with a guest to guide the discussion. One of the hosts, Robin Ince, mentioned <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, saying that every time he reads it he finds new insight in its pages. It's my experience that despite being a relatively slim novella, the complex characters and removed perspective provides a wealth of wisdom and observations. It got me thinking about art that endures throughout your life, that helps to shape you at different moments. I think this is one of the qualities of the best art, that each time you go back to it it is richer and more in-depth than before. Re-readings and re-watchings allow for greater emotional impact, instead of diminishing returns. The art endures throughout your life.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-01-04-a-response-to-laurie-gough/">A response to Laurie Gough</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-01-04T00:00:00.000Z">January 4, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>In another example of running a controversial story to get clicks, the Huffington Post published an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-gough/selfpublishing-an-insult-_b_13606682.html">article</a> by Laurie Gough that argues that self-publishing is an insult to the written word. (Of course, they also published <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samita-sarkar/selfpublishing-an-insult-_1_b_13903202.html">a reaction</a> to the original article, so they have it both ways.) As a self-published author myself, I disagree with Laurie's argument. There has been a few angry responses to this opinion piece, but I thought I'd offer some personal thoughts on why I take issue with it.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-12-29-best-of-2016/">Best of 2016</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-12-29T00:00:00.000Z">December 29, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>2016 was a curious year. Politics <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">ate </a><a href="what-does-it-matter/">itself</a> and <a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">the internet </a>took over all discourse. But personally, it was pretty good. I published two books, one a collection of <a href="/amberstars/">short stories </a>and one <a href="/remain-vigilant/">playscript</a>. I wrote this blog every week, made a website and got in the habit of producing things regularly. I went to Skye for a long week and went to loads of gigs. It's odd having this dichotomy between the terrible news of politics and the quite good personal life.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-12-21-2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">2016: The Year the Internet took over</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2016-12-21T00:00:00.000Z">December 21, 2016</time><br/></i>
<p>What a year. It started with David Bowie dying and somehow went downhill from there. <a href="/brexit-and-the-story-we-have-been-told/">A rabid </a>media stirring up <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">hate</a> forced the British people to shoot themselves in the foot, whilst in the USA hate and intolerance won the day- if not the popular vote.</p>

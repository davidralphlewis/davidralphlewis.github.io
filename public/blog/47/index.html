<p>I've finished reading <em>Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction</em> by Jeff Vandermeer. It's a great read, full of useful information and exercises. Mostly, it is a nuts and bolts guide to stories and their various elements, characters, plotting, but the way it presented and the advice it gives about the imagination make it truly unique.</p>

<p><em>I wrote this for <a href="http://moreincommon.tumblr.com/">More in Common</a> from the Royal Court, which is well worth checking out. It was written fairly quickly so it's not perfect.</em></p>

<p><em>Given the clusterfuck that is happening in the UK at the moment, I'm probably going to be doing a few more political posts in the future. Just a heads up as I try work out what the hell is going on through words. I understand it is much, much more complex than I can do justice to, but this is just one take on it</em></p>

<p>On Saturday, some wanker walked into a nightclub in Orlando and killed 50 people with a rifle, injuring many others. It was an act of hate against the LGBTQ community and a disgusting act of violence and terror. People were understandably shocked and deeply affected by the news.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I got frustrated with my writing and decided to mess around with my first drafts and discarded attempts at stories. They had been languishing on my hard drive for years. I wasn't publishing them and they weren't being seen by anyone. To be honest, most of the stories just weren't very good.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-06-02-may-link-round-up/">May Link Round-up</a> </h2>

<p>Another month gone already. It feels like no time at all since I wrote my last link roundup, but here we are again. This month I've mostly been reading <em>The Bone Clocks</em> &amp; <em>Wonderbook</em>, but in between there's been a number of good articles.</p>
</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2016-05-24-the-bone-clocks-by-david-mitchell/">The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell</a> </h2>

<p>I've been a fan of David Mitchell since reading <em>Cloud Atlas</em> in my early twenties. Since then, I have enjoyed almost everything he has written, so I was excited to finally get round to <em>The Bone Clocks</em>. I've somehow never tackled it, possibly because at 500 pages it's quite a time investment.</p>

<p>I mentioned in a previous <a href="/the-work-never-stops/">post</a> how I was inspired to share more of my writing by<a href="http://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/"><em>Show Your Work!</em></a> by Austin Kleon. This little book has been surprisingly helpful in sharing work, but also producing it. Six weeks into following some of the principles, I thought I would expand on how it has helped me.</p>

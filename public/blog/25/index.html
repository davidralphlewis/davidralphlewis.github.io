<p>Houses have faded to grey. Colour slumbers.<br>
We drag our feet down monochrome<br>
streets, blinded by persistent monotony,<br>
unable to see the edge of the pavement<br>
or the bricks of the walls surrounding us.<br>
Corners are indistinct. We see only lead,<br>
tarmac and endless concrete, nothing more.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I went to a Quaker wedding. [^1] As part of the ceremony, we sat in silence for close to an hour, punctuated now and then by someone speaking briefly, then lapsing back into silence. It was an unusual ceremony. I felt uncomfortable in the silence. I had the urge to speak, to do something to break the quiet. Other people who weren't Quakers found it difficult as well. Personally, I think I am not used to that amount of quiet contemplation. I was reminded of the famous Blaise Pascal quote: “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”</p>

<h3>16 AWFUL THINGS HEADS OF STATE HAVE TWEETED TODAY THAT YOU WON'T BELIEVE! GLOBAL WARMING WILL BE 'FANTASTIC FOR BUSINESS' SAYS POWERFUL SOCIOPATH! SOMEONE DID A THING AND PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED- LIVE UPDATES!</h3>  
<p>One of the best and worst things about the internet is the amount of freely available information. It's obviously a good thing, just look at Wikipedia. We can access almost any important information and get a pretty good summary. This is a golden age for progress. The creation of the internet is a bigger revolution than the printing press. It's like the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy made real, only without the large comforting 'Don't Panic' sign on the cover.</p>

<p>There's a magical tool that allows you to focus right in on any problem. Or you can broaden it out and use it to explore the inner workings of your mind. It has endless possibilities and applications. I'm talking about paper of course.</p>

<h2>Dice</h2>
<p>There's no stopping the game.<br>
We are small plastic counters<br>
on a vast, overwhelming board.<br>
Of course we have some choices<br>
but are constrained by set paths.</p>

<h2>Astonishing</h2>
<p>Waking up first, listening to<br>
your breaths like small waves</p>

<h2>Mountain</h2>
<p>Forever reaching for<br>
uncaring heavens, you<br>
stoic stone observer<br>
of our slight lives.<br>
Eternally unmovable,<br>
never changing.</p>

<h2>Dance</h2>
<p>At the start, a needle dropped<br>
in the darkness and all the nothing<br>
spun, starting up the groove.</p>

<h2>Dubious</h2>
<p>You are a flickering pixel<br>
among millions, of unsure<br>
colour, generating an image<br>
that you can never see.</p>

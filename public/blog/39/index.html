<i><time datetime="2019-04-01T00:00:00.000Z">April 1, 2019</time><br/></i>
<p>For the last couple of years I've taken part in NaPoWriMo, where I try to write a poem every day in April. I've really enjoyed the process. It's got me back into writing and has helped produce some of my favourite poems. And some of my least favourites, but the beauty of this writing exercise is you carry on regardless. I also really enjoyed publishing them in public last year. It forced me to be accountable to myself and not skip any days, whilst also trying to make them as good as possible.</p>

<p>I though I was a good typist. I've written on computers all my life. I type fast. But the truth is half my time is spent correcting errors. I write fast but sloppy. So I started to learn to touch type.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2019-02-08-sharp-objects-and-genre-blindspots/">Sharp Objects and genre blindspots</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2019-02-08T00:00:00.000Z">February 8, 2019</time><br/></i>
<p>Genre fiction is often used to describe science fiction and fantasy, but everything fits into a genre. People tend to dismiss sci-fi as not belonging to the real world and following set formulas. I admit to similar prejudices with crime novels, particularly those with detectives or journalists trying to solve a murder. There are some twists and red herrings, the protagonist gets personally involved due to their issues but by the end of the story it is all neatly resolved and the murderer is revealed. This is the narrow-minded view I have of the crime genre.</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, I finished two major projects I had been working on for ages, a short story collection and a poetry collection. I finished them to a stage where only minor changes were needed.[^1] These sprawling ideas I had been carrying around in my head, my notebook and several disparate files suddenly existed as completed manuscripts.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2019-01-15-annihilation/">Thoughts on 'Annihilation'</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2019-01-15T00:00:00.000Z">January 15, 2019</time><br/></i>
<p>For my first book of the year, I sped through Jeff Vandermeer's <em>Annihilation</em>, the first in the Southern Reach Trilogy. It is classified as science fiction, but in this case it seems to be a catch-all category of &quot;I dunno. Seems weird.&quot; Science fiction isn't really a good classification for this odd novel. From the very first moments, it is clear that this strange little book is delving deep into horror.</p>

<p>I'll finally tidy up this place and keep it neat. It's too dark! Too many cobwebs and not enough flaming torches. I'll stop leaving tomes half opened on the lectern. Need to keep my ingredients in order. I can never find salamander's tails when I need them. Similarly, I will stop leaving half-finished potions around the place. The number of times I've been interrupted then come back to find the laboratory filled with a putrid purple smoke, I tell you... It's not good. I'm four hundred and seventy-two, I need to start clearing up after myself.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-12-28-best-of-2018/">Best of 2018</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2018-12-28T00:00:00.000Z">December 28, 2018</time><br/></i>
<p>It's that time again when I examine what media I've consumed over the past twelve months and pick my favourites. Defining the best of anything is an entirely subjective act that nevertheless, I try to do every year. I've moved away from trying to pick the 'best' of anything as they are all different experiences, so instead, I have chosen a few in each category I like.</p>

<p>In previous years I've written <a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">rambly</a>, <a href="/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/">angry</a> blog posts that tried to make sense of the world around me and mostly failed. This year I've given up trying to understand the world and instead have written a poem to sum up the year:<br /></p>

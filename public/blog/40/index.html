<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-04-08-napowrimo-day-8/">NaPoWriMo 2018 Day 8</a> </h2>

<h2>Aquatic</h2>
<p>When the ice caps finally melted,<br>
flooding the globe one hot summer,<br>
consuming many major cities,<br>
We were caught ignorant and unaware.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-04-07-napowrimo-day-7/">NaPoWriMo 2018 Day 7</a> </h2>

<h2>Gleaming</h2>
<p>Everything is precious in this early light.<br>
A fox shuffles between discarded kebabs,<br>
with shimmering fur, golden and new.<br>
A high-rise, shining, is a forgotten temple.<br>
Glass shards scattered over the pavement<br>
are countless stars, illuminating the tarmac.<br>
Emerald leaves grow from amber branches<br>
to shine on us both, staggering stragglers,<br>
almost home, with the rarest crystals for eyes.<br>
Overnight, this city was built again out of silver,<br>
just for me and you, my sapphire love.</p>

<h2>Fog</h2>
<p>The white cliffs had no end,<br>
edges eaten by cloud,<br>
an invisible sea below.</p>
</p>
<p>

<h2>Boundary</h2>
<p>I am mostly empty,<br>
Ninety-nine percent space.</p>
</p>

<h2>Discovery</h2>
<p>After crossing the vast nothingness,<br>
months trapped in a steel coffin<br>
with inches between us and death,<br>
we crashed into the red dust.</p>
</p>
<p>

<h2>Apologise</h2>
<p>Fine, Iâ€™m sorry I punched you<br>
hard in the eye just now.<br>
But you walked in front of my fist-<br>
What did you expect?</p>
</p>
<p>

<h2>Grey</h2>
<p>He lived his days in monochrome;<br>
grey suit, white shirt, grey tie,<br>
bought in bulk to avoid choice.</p>
</p>

<p>I'm doing this again. Last year I quite enjoyed the process of creating a brand new poem every day in April so have decided to do it again.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-03-25-not-writing-enough/">Creative Anxieties: Fear of not writing enough</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z">March 25, 2018</time><br/></i>
<div>This blog post is late. I was meant to write it last week, but life got it the way, as it always seems to do. It's not just this week's though; the self-imposed schedule I imposed at the start of the year has slowly slipped away. This, inevitably, leads to guilt and worry. More specifically, I always feel like I'm not writing enough. I need to produce more. When I do write, it never feels like enough.</div>  
<!--more-->  
<p>It's not just me though. Have a look at this thread from Rebecca Williams about the constant guilt and pressure she feels to continue writing:</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2018-02-28-30-things-i-dont-know/">30 things I don't know at 30</a> </h2>

<p>There's a certain kind of article you stumble across now and then which consists of important things people have learnt about life. Usually these are linked to a milestone age, like 50, or 10,000 days on Earth. Lists of advice that seems wise and sage and the accumulation of years of study. This is not one of those articles.</p>

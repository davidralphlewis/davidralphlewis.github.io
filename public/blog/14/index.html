<p>We've done everything we possibly can<br>
they proclaim on nightly broadcasts,<br>
shaking their fists for emphasis as if<br>
describing ineffective ancient magic<br>
runes in the air, as globs of engine oil<br>
dribble down their chins, distracting<br>
from the soft focus, where shadows<br>
tear copper wire from the concrete.</p>

<p><em>This is a series where I interview poets about their process in regards to a single poem. Today I am honoured to have the fantastic Liam Bates, whose pamphlet</em> <a href="https://www.brokensleepbooks.com/product-page/liam-bates-working-animals">Working Animals</a> <em>was one of <a href="/poetry-books/">my highlights</a> of last year. Today he's discussing a poem that was first published in <a href="https://www.anthropocenepoetry.org/post/2-poems-by-liam-bates">Anthropocene</a> on 20th December.</em></p>

<p>This January has been more miserable than most, grey and cold with a lockdown over us. It feels like a lifetime since further restrictions were announced. So I've had a lot of time to stay inside and consume media. Here's some things I enjoyed.</p>

I cannot look away from the whorl of galaxies<br>
tucked into each curled petal, the supermassive<br>
black hole that sits on top of a stamen, dragging<br>
all light and time towards it. In the pint glass<br>
sepals shimmer with the burning of millions of dead<br>
stars, buds flicker with a pulse of decaying planck<br>
seconds, the superpositions of many possible worlds<br>
blur each leaf and thorn and somewhere in each bloom<br>
I am meeting you for the first time, walking around<br>
the castle, studying in Birmingham, waiting to be<br>
born, dying, watching a bouquet, unable to stay still,<br>
unable to look away from the constant, dizzying spin.</p>

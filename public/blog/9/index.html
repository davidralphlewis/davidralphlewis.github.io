You imagined | a field transmuted | into endless red bricks.<br>
You | hammered a sign | into the soil and | walked away.<br>
Now we carve | out mud and sand | mix and bake together<br>
earth | into our inferno | churn the loose |  ground into cubes<br>
make straight | lines out of leaves | that only want to curve.<br>
You | had a simple idea | thought a while | and called it a city.<br>
We are the ones | who stacked the | ground on top of itself,<br>
who | spun streets from | the threads of | the slip breeze.<br>
And when this | empty space has | been alchemically set <br>
into |  a new epicentre | of industry and | fearful commerce <br>
there will be no | monument to all | of our cracked hands <br>
that | struggled against | nature to lay out | these streets. <br>
Our fingerprints | will instead be | embedded into concrete <br>
the | echo of our voices | will be audible | in every room. <br>

<p>February has flown by on gales and storms. I've been really busy, performing two feature sets for Fen Speak and (Sm)art Festival, which were wonderful. I also applied and got a new job, turned 34 and spent too many hours lost in Hyrule. Phew. As a consequence of all this real life business, the things I have consumed have been limited.</p>

<p>In the early days of this blog (5 years and almost 400 posts ago) I used to do monthly roundups. I've fallen out of the practice but have decided to revive it for this year, having been inspired by<a href="https://kottke.org/22/01/my-recent-media-diet-end-2021.">Jason Kottke</a> and others. After all, what is a personal website for if not for my ill informed opinions on popular culture? So here is the media I have consumed for January 2022.</p>

<p>Last year I got through 65 books. (I've kept a list <a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books-read-2021">here</a>) Because I'm not really using GoodReads anymore,  I thought I would curate a few of my highlights:</p>

<p>Yet again, I sit down to summarize the year gone by and yet again I find myself struggling for words. It has been another year of chaos and contradiction, of pandemic and freedom, of confusion and connection. As I write, I am ill with COVID 19, somewhat inevitably being hit by omicron. Of course, I am lucky enough to be vaccinated, so I have avoided the worst of it. I started the year in lockdown and end it in isolation. Inbetween have been moments of connection and moments of joy.</p>

<p>I've been thinking about <em>The Green Knight</em> ever since I saw it a month ago. The film is a hypnotic blend of English myth, dream like strangeness and stiking imagery.[^1] . What has kept me returning to the film in my head is how little it explains for the audience. There is a clear quest with monsters and talking animals, but within this framework it resists easy interpretation. There's no simple explanation of what the different perspectives mean or why Gaiwan is on the quest. Instead, it leaves the meaning up to the audience.</p>

<p>Once again I closed off last year and started the new one by filling out a <a href="https://yearcompass.com/">year compass</a> booklet. Although the years are arbitrary, I find this time to reflect and reset immensely valuable.</p>

<h2> <a href="/2023-in-review">2023 in review: Poisoning the Well</a> </h2>

<p>2023 was another year of unnecessary wars and suffering, with Russia and Ukraine rumbling on with no end in sight. Israel responded to a terrorist attack with maximum aggression against civilians, seeking vengeance against an oppressed population. It's hard to focus on the positives when the news seems so relentlessly bleak and when history repeats itself so frequently. Collectively, we never seem to learn the lessons of the past.</p>

<p>Once again, you find yourself barefoot,<br>
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps<br>
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge<br>
of your island, listening to my breathing,<br>
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle<br>
sigh, the dance of a million small particles<br>
rearranging themselves in new patterns.<br>
The sun is already setting, elongating<br>
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and<br>
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air.</p>

<p>Briefly, over lightly settled night,<br>
tungsten filaments flame out.<br>
Sunk in owl hoots and the scratching<br>
of small claws on terracotta pots,<br>
we feel the planet spin below our feet<br>
so fast there's no chance for dizziness.</p>

<p>A flutter of flame consumed leaves<br>
falls onto my crown, drifting embers.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-10-20-The-news-was-canceled-today/">The news was cancelled today</a> </h2>

<p>because there was no danger or threat,<br>
no unwanted developments. There were no murders<br>
because we melted down our knives and guns<br>
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.<br>
War is now an archaic word, like famine<br>
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago<br>
and every person has enough to eat and drink,<br>
has all the resources and support they need<br>
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone<br>
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,<br>
but it is never unexpected and always<br>
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion<br>
or anything other difference, is a bright candle<br>
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone<br>
combined together to light up the dark.</p>

<p>Nothing grows here but sea kale<br>
and spite. We walk towards a horizon<br>
that refuses to get any closer,<br>
under the sun's pixelated glare.</p>

<p>In 2018 I was writing poems and putting erasure poems onto Instagram (much the same as today.) A small press called <em>Selcouth Station</em> approached me and asked if I wanted to make a pamphlet around those erasure poems.  After a lot of work, the result was a hybrid pamphlet called <em>Our Voices in the Chaos</em>.</p>

<p>Amber and scarlet triangles describe<br>
the island. These winding lanes</p>

<p>Once again I closed off last year and started the new one by filling out a <a href="https://yearcompass.com/">year compass</a> booklet. Although the years are arbitrary, I find this time to reflect and reset immensely valuable.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-12-31-2023-in-review/">2023 in review: Poisoning the Well</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-12-31T00:00:00.000Z">December 31, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>2023 was another year of unnecessary wars and suffering, with Russia and Ukraine rumbling on with no end in sight. Israel responded to a terrorist attack with maximum aggression against civilians, seeking vengeance against an oppressed population. It's hard to focus on the positives when the news seems so relentlessly bleak and when history repeats itself so frequently. Collectively, we never seem to learn the lessons of the past.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-11-28-Return-to-Me/">Return to Me</a> </h2>

<p>Once again, you find yourself barefoot,<br>
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps<br>
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge<br>
of your island, listening to my breathing,<br>
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle<br>
sigh, the dance of a million small particles<br>
rearranging themselves in new patterns.<br>
The sun is already setting, elongating<br>
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and<br>
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air.</p>
</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-11-22-Lost-the-Path/">Lost the Path</a> </h2>

<p>Briefly, over lightly settled night,<br>
tungsten filaments flame out.<br>
Sunk in owl hoots and the scratching<br>
of small claws on terracotta pots,<br>
we feel the planet spin below our feet<br>
so fast there's no chance for dizziness.</p>
</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-11-07-Better-Now/">Better Now</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-11-07T00:00:00.000Z">November 7, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>A flutter of flame consumed leaves<br>
falls onto my crown, drifting embers.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-10-20-The-news-was-canceled-today/">The news was cancelled today</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-10-20T00:00:00.000Z">October 20, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>because there was no danger or threat,<br>
no unwanted developments. There were no murders<br>
because we melted down our knives and guns<br>
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.<br>
War is now an archaic word, like famine<br>
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago<br>
and every person has enough to eat and drink,<br>
has all the resources and support they need<br>
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone<br>
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,<br>
but it is never unexpected and always<br>
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion<br>
or anything other difference, is a bright candle<br>
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone<br>
combined together to light up the dark.</p>

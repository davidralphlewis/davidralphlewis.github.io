<p>Today my mind is like confetti thrown<br>
to the wind, like a website with every<br>
space filled with adverts, all flashing<br>
for my attention, like a river delta<br>
as hundreds of tributaries race towards<br>
the ocean. Do you understand? It's like<br>
I've drunk ten espressos and all I can hear<br>
is the thumping house beat of my heart or<br>
like I am dust in the depths of the galaxy<br>
not yet ready to coalesce into planets.<br>
You must know what I mean. It's like I'm<br>
a beam of light shot through a prism,<br>
or my thoughts are cryptic crossword clues<br>
or I'm a CRT television stuck between<br>
channels, half images looping back over<br>
themselves. What I'm trying to say is<br>
I'm like a lizard darting across hot<br>
sands, it's like I'm caught in a washing<br>
machine near the end of the cycle, like<br>
I've become a comet entering the atmosphere<br>
before inevitably burning, disintegrating,<br>
becoming nothing more than fine ash rain.</p>

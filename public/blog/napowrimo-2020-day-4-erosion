<p>On this day, a room darkened by a flash,<br>
unfamiliar faces are made abstract by<br>
developing camera technology. One<br>
is probably mine, now a stranger.</p>
<p>Each cell of my body has died<br>
and been reborn in the years since.<br>
I have cleaned grey shavings of my<br>
skin from shelves with a yellow cloth.</p>
<p>I am nothing more than a sand storm<br>
thrown together by accidental currents,<br>
thinking itself to be unified as most<br>
of the cloud is forced forward by winds,<br>
whilst specks drift and drop like snow onto<br>
the roofs, the roads, the waiting ground.</p>
<p>In this photo on the timeline, you see them,<br>
parts of personality left behind and discarded,<br>
particles becoming blurred spots on the lens.</p>

<p>Prompt wasÂ  &quot;Redo- a poem of recreation, change and makeovers&quot; from the poetry at the time of being alone group. Not super happy with this one but tomorrow is another day.</p>

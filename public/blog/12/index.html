<p>March was another busy month as I adjusted to my new job and did lots of wedding admin. I also prepped and published a weird little game/ poetry pamphlet about being lost in an everchanging city, which you can find more about <a href="/reality-adjustments/">here.</a></p>

<p>Today I'm releasing an interactive poetry pamphlet called <em>Reality Adjustments.</em> It's a surreal dive into a city that is always changing, with mutating streets, strange jobs and one or two apocalypses There are different paths to follow, multiple different endings and elements that change depending on where you have been before.</p>

You imagined | a field transmuted | into endless red bricks.<br>
You | hammered a sign | into the soil and | walked away.<br>
Now we carve | out mud and sand | mix and bake together<br>
earth | into our inferno | churn the loose |  ground into cubes<br>
make straight | lines out of leaves | that only want to curve.<br>
You | had a simple idea | thought a while | and called it a city.<br>
We are the ones | who stacked the | ground on top of itself,<br>
who | spun streets from | the threads of | the slip breeze.<br>
And when this | empty space has | been alchemically set <br>
into |  a new epicentre | of industry and | fearful commerce <br>
there will be no | monument to all | of our cracked hands <br>
that | struggled against | nature to lay out | these streets. <br>
Our fingerprints | will instead be | embedded into concrete <br>
the | echo of our voices | will be audible | in every room. <br>

<p>I wrote the first draft of this at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic">Bristol Tonic</a>, in the half time. The prompt was 'We built this city'.</p>

<p>February has flown by on gales and storms. I've been really busy, performing two feature sets for Fen Speak and (Sm)art Festival, which were wonderful. I also applied and got a new job, turned 34 and spent too many hours lost in Hyrule. Phew. As a consequence of all this real life business, the things I have consumed have been limited.</p>

<p>In the early days of this blog (5 years and almost 400 posts ago) I used to do monthly roundups. I've fallen out of the practice but have decided to revive it for this year, having been inspired by<a href="https://kottke.org/22/01/my-recent-media-diet-end-2021.">Jason Kottke</a> and others. After all, what is a personal website for if not for my ill informed opinions on popular culture? So here is the media I have consumed for January 2022.</p>

<p>Last year I got through 65 books. (I've kept a list <a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books-read-2021">here</a>) Because I'm not really using GoodReads anymore,  I thought I would curate a few of my highlights:</p>

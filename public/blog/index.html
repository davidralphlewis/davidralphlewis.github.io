<p>Recently, I've been enjoying making zines. There's something fun about using your hands to make an object, especially when so much of our lives are digital. I've added a few one pagers to my <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/projects/">projects page</a> and <a href="https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/">itch.io</a>.</p>

<p>becoming more than simple root by<br>
breathing in sweet loam<br>
rolling a body into a pebble<br>
churning under the surface<br>
while dreaming deep in fever<br>
of the power to divide<br>
endlessly, divide endlessly<br>
while never blinking</p>

<p>I've been the forest groaning as the winds pick up,<br>
a lizard panicking from rock to cool rock as drops fall<br>
like meteors onto the cracked earth. Mostly, you've<br>
been a leaky fishing boat anchored outside the bay,<br>
sinking a little deeper into the churning horizon with a sigh.<br>
Waves slap higher and harder, evening darkens too soon.<br>
I've wanted to be a life raft but have found myself<br>
a hollow statue instead, limestone filling with water.<br>
Shall we stay put, dance a slow waltz, your head<br>
on my chest? Shall we linger as sparks appear around<br>
our eyebrows, as our hair lifts in sudden static surprise?<br>
Or lets throw on some thrash metal, pull apart our house<br>
brick by brick, rip apart each and every supporting wall.<br>
Either way, we'll soon both be sea glass, cloudy<br>
emerald pools where lightning raged against the sand.</p>

<pre>
One IKEA bag full of ill judged clothes - baggy shirts,
faded bootcut jeans. Another holding new pans, 
an orange duvet still wrapped in plastic. Flyers 
for welcome parties and printouts and maps 
lie scattered over the plywood desk.
No one here knows or cares who I am
<p>so I am a blackboard scrubbed clean. 
I decide not to be defined by worry.
Starting at my acne-pitted forehead, 
    I peel off the shape of who I was
       and, laughing to the empty room,
       
                  I am recast without anyone noticing,
                    my script punched up and rewritten.</p>
<p>I become  the city’s traffic pulse,
black coffee      unexpected fireworks, 
a bass drop    in a sweaty club      at two am, 
become a dust mite      spinning out</p>
<p>caught in a shaft</p>
<p>of dawn light

<pre>Warped by the pressure of so many centuries,
barnacled statues crawl out of the surf
to converge on me, alone on this winter shore.
<p>Surrounding me in marble, they demand a detailed
account of their rich and varied history.
What do I know of their deeds and exploits?</p>
<p>I cough
mumble about a few myths
a story in a picture book
I saw once</p>
<p>maybe</p>
<p>Is that all you know of us? they ask. We wrestled
with the fear of a winter sun suddenly diminishing.
We never once considered glaciers to be mutable,
and we always thought our land was permanent.</p>
<p>We created detailed plans for a future that would
never arrive, inscribed in detail into our city walls.
We loved each other with such intensity we thought
we could mould the very oceans to do our bidding.</p>
<p>Together we danced and laughed and wept and dreamed.
It is your duty to be honest. Is that all that remains of ​​us?</p>
<p>I consider my shoelaces

<h2> <a href="/posts/Chasing-flow/">Chasing Flow</a> </h2>

<p>I was speaking with a friend about exercise. This friend has known me for a long time and has seen me try various exercises only to drop them. I have been doing weightlifting consistently now for about a year, so he asked why this has worked for me. I said it was about focus and the necessity to concentrate on lifting the heavy thing. The more I thought about it, the more I realised this is what I have been chasing in a lot of activities, the feeling of complete focus. It's the same with swimming, where you have to focus on your breath and each stroke to push forward.</p>

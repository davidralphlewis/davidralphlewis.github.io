<p>When I wrote about <a href="/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/">creativity and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I'd write up the process in case it's useful for anyone else.</p>

<p>Streets now sliced streaks of<br>
shimmering turquoise, scarlet and<br>
funeral grey blurs, suggestions of<br>
doors, signs and windows barely<br>
registering. How long, running for a<br>
lifetime? No wheezes, no stitches, no<br>
sweat. Pavement treadmills, that<br>
red car ahead suspended in<br>
motion. I need to catch up. Why? No<br>
time for questions. Legs now<br>
pistons, push my hazy memory of a<br>
body forever forward as the city<br>
loops over again towards the<br>
vanishing point, never reached â€”</p>

<i>Fri May 24 2024 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (British Summer Time)<br/></i>
<p>For the last few years, I've been playing <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> as a Dungeon Master. This is the person who creates the world and encounters for the players to explore. Every session is fun and I enjoy inventing increasingly strange situations for the party to react to.</p>

<p>I have been unable to describe the shape<br>
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning<br>
for our forgotten winter in a language<br>
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky<br>
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,<br>
orange markers bleeding through the page.<br>
My garden whispers like a fading dream<br>
as thoughts transmute to smoke,<br>
wisp and separate and float. Recently</p>

<p>with lint and grime? Oil seeps into every<br>
exposed surface, delays the build up of rust,<br>
but decline is inevitable. When did you last<br>
consider your camshaft bearing, your crankshaft<br>
drillings, your line shaft? You forgot to follow<br>
the established maintenance schedule,<br>
didn't you? Made a checklist then delayed<br>
consulting it. Eventually, your pistons<br>
will stop pumping, a spark plug will fail,<br>
your alternator will burn out or a wire<br>
to your battery will fray. How much grease<br>
lines the walls of your intake manifold?<br>
Is it enough? When did a professional<br>
last give you a look over? Your catalytic<br>
convertor is clogged, you are speaking<br>
in toxic fumes. How long has your engine<br>
management light been flashing on and off?</p>

<p>Recently, I was speaking to someone about journaling, and I casually mentioned I'd kept a diary consistently for over ten years. As I said it, it seemed wrong, so I checked the next day. Yup. Over ten years.</p>

<p>'You don't want to end up like me,'<br>
the man on stage screeches.<br>
Laughter unstoppable now, like<br>
a falling body embracing gravity.<br>
'I'm serious. Why is that funny?'<br>
I feel three hundred people's heat</p>

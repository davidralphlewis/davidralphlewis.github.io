<h2> <a href="/posts/going-live/">Going Live</a> </h2>

<p>if they drag you from your car<br>
aim blows at your skull<br>
try to burn down your hotel</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/Abyssal/">Abyssal</a> </h2>

<p>Dark of course, but dancing shades<br>
that lap and swirl and churn and roil.<br>
Her eyes have depths she did not realise.<br>
No sound but the slap, clap<br>
of the metal hull bracing, leaping.</p>
</p>
<p>
<h2> <a href="/posts/First-Day-of-Mourning/">The First Day of Mourning</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-07-11T00:00:00.000Z">July 11, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>Soon, they joined together in hordes<br>
of increasing size, shudders running over<br>
their bodies like waves in a storm.<br>
They sat together over the cenotaph,<br>
the shopping centre, spilled out into two<br>
lane roads, holding each other as their sobs<br>
became life rafts. Confused crowds watched,<br>
unwilling to leap over to understanding.<br>
Soon traffic stopped altogether, drivers<br>
unable to see through salt water.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-06-22-Quick-Dice-Poetry-Exercise/">Quick Dice Poetry Exercise</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-06-22T00:00:00.000Z">June 22, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>When I wrote about <a href="/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/">creativity and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I'd write up the process in case it's useful for anyone else.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-05-29-Always-That-Chimeric-Skyline/">Always That Chimeric Skyline</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-05-29T00:00:00.000Z">May 29, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>Streets now sliced streaks of<br>
shimmering turquoise, scarlet and<br>
funeral grey blurs, suggestions of<br>
doors, signs and windows barely<br>
registering. How long, running for a<br>
lifetime? No wheezes, no stitches, no<br>
sweat. Pavement treadmills, that<br>
red car ahead suspended in<br>
motion. I need to catch up. Why? No<br>
time for questions. Legs now<br>
pistons, push my hazy memory of a<br>
body forever forward as the city<br>
loops over again towards the<br>
vanishing point, never reached â€”</p>
</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-05-24-Creativity-lessons from-DnD/">Creativity lessons from Dungeons and Dragons</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-05-24T00:00:00.000Z">May 24, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>For the last few years, I've been playing <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> as a Dungeon Master. This is the person who creates the world and encounters for the players to explore. Every session is fun and I enjoy inventing increasingly strange situations for the party to react to.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-05-14-A-Ritual/">A Ritual</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-05-14T00:00:00.000Z">May 14, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>I have been unable to describe the shape<br>
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning<br>
for our forgotten winter in a language<br>
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky<br>
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,<br>
orange markers bleeding through the page.<br>
My garden whispers like a fading dream<br>
as thoughts transmute to smoke,<br>
wisp and separate and float. Recently</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2024-05-03-G man/">G Man</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2024-05-03T00:00:00.000Z">May 3, 2024</time><br/></i>
<p>When asked to provide an account<br>
he spoke only in pollen drifts.</p>

<p>with lint and grime? Oil seeps into every<br>
exposed surface, delays the build up of rust,<br>
but decline is inevitable. When did you last<br>
consider your camshaft bearing, your crankshaft<br>
drillings, your line shaft? You forgot to follow<br>
the established maintenance schedule,<br>
didn't you? Made a checklist then delayed<br>
consulting it. Eventually, your pistons<br>
will stop pumping, a spark plug will fail,<br>
your alternator will burn out or a wire<br>
to your battery will fray. How much grease<br>
lines the walls of your intake manifold?<br>
Is it enough? When did a professional<br>
last give you a look over? Your catalytic<br>
convertor is clogged, you are speaking<br>
in toxic fumes. How long has your engine<br>
management light been flashing on and off?</p>

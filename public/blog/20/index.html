<p>When the earth was correcting<br>
our cabled bodies were sprawled<br>
irreparable, most sensory inputs<br>
disconnected, transmissions down,<br>
smashed by careless hands wielding<br>
boulders. When networks were down,<br>
when communities were rewiring<br>
like dust scattered in sunbeams,<br>
We stayed immobile in deserts,<br>
newly separate and confused<br>
listening to automated number<br>
stations, comfort in the night.</p>

<p>Do you remember the first time<br>
you saw those mountains? How they<br>
towered above you? Do you remember<br>
your unbounded freedom, how paths<br>
lay before you, infinite in choice,<br>
how the sun spun above you and grass<br>
regrew at your feet? How you would play<br>
your strange instrument to bring forth<br>
new light upon the surface of Hyrule?</p>

<p>Don't climb up those ancient stone steps<br>
carved into the slope of our tallest mountain<br>
up to that egg that sits on the summit,<br>
the size of a temple. You don't need<br>
to draw those eight strange instruments<br>
or watch them hover in the air before you<br>
to play a melody you always knew, no<br>
hands strumming strings, no breath over<br>
the reeds. You could simply stay here.</p>

<p>After <a href="/myths-of-history/">yesterday's post</a>, I happened to be reading <em>The People's History of the United States</em> by Howard Zinn. He writes about the reaction to the protests about Columbus statues in the nineties:</p>

<p>Every country is deluded in how they narrate the past. No history is complete and each history is a story shaped to make the narrators feel better. But I think here in Britain, we are more deluded than most.</p>

<p>From her vantage point of the second highest branch, Cassie saw it first, growing over the horizon like a bruise. She often spent afternoons by herself in the garden, away from the noise of the house- The music pounding from her brother Jamie’s closed door, Sampson barking at nothing, the rumbling of the ancient boiler. Her parents constantly screaming at each other. Or worse, being polite through gritted teeth. Cassie preferred the relative silence of the garden. Birds might chirrup at each other, but it never sounded angry. For most of the Easter holidays, she had got into the habit of marching out in the morning, her current book under her arm, with cheese and tomato sandwiches and lemonade in her backpack, plus another book just in case the first ran out. Suggestions of family days out and trips to places had been stubbornly resisted. She didn’t want to hang around her loser family at all, even if it meant going to a cool castle.</p>

<p>I was very lucky to have a poem on BBC Radio Bristol's Upload show. The poem is called Encrypted and was written for <a href="https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=881907221970150&amp;ref=content_filter">Tonic</a>, which is an amazing night. You get given a prompt and you have a month to write a piece for it.</p>

<p>Just before the door swung open, Amber was certain she could hear voices. When she walked into the small office, they had lapsed into silence. It had sounded like Tom. Great. He was meant to be the only friendly one. He sat at his desk, pretending to concentrate on work, music on as usual. Derek and Robyn ignored her as well. All three of them wore headphones, lost in their own world. Amber shuffled over to her desk, clutching her cup of tea, trying to ignore the tension in the room and failing. She wasnâ€™t paranoid any more, she was certain.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Blimey, it's the year Twenty Twenty, a year that sounds incredibly futuristic. We're past the setting of <em>Blade Runner. </em>The world is different and weirder in ways we couldn't imagine before.</p>

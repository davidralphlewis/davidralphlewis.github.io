<p>Blackbirds sing from the only tree<br>
left standing on land scrubbed clean.<br>
I am watching these buildings awake<br>
as hidden beaks and wings call to light;</p>

<p>Following on from last week's <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-weaponised-nostalgia/">year in review post</a>, which was more political in nature, I thought I would take some time to reflect on last year from a personal perspective. Each year I go through the <a href="https://yearcompass.com/">Year Compass</a> as a ritual to close down the last year and set goals for the next, so this post is informed by that.</p>

<p>Another year of political chaos, with three prime ministers, war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis. It has been a lot.  Instead of returning to relative stability, the ripple effects of lockdowns have continued to have a huge impact and will likely reverberate for years to come.</p>

gorse opened exploratory<br>
canary buds, lending<br>
a perfume of coconut<br>

<p>November rattled by. I thought I was going to read more due to the dark days and frost but actually I went to a lot of gigs and generally enjoyed myself. And here in Bristol, the frost only started in December. Here's what I did read and consume.</p>

<p>After I got married at the end of September, I went on honeymoon to Croatia. It was bliss- two weeks of lying on the beach, reading books and occasionally swimming. Now of course I'm back to real life with all the admin and bills to pay.</p>

<p>I was on honeymoon in Croatia for the start of October, so I relaxed on a beach and read loads of books. It was great. It got me back into reading a lot more. Now as it gets colder all I want to do is to hunker down with good books.</p>

<p>I maintained the gears of the moon as a university job. On my empty days, I polished the levers, tightened the cranks and ensured there was enough oil to guarantee a smooth rise. At night, the company had a whole team on standby for the show, but during the day I was left alone with the machinery, inside a vast and echoing warehouse. My jobs did not take very long. I was a glorified security guard. Most of my shift passed in the staff room, deep under the surface, surrounded by the whirr and sigh of complex systems I could barely understand. I ate my tuna sandwiches, read terrible sci-fi novels, listened to music on my half broken walkman held together by duct tape and watched money for my studies crawl up in a ticker inside my head.</p>

<p>Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
morning shudders, barely starts<br>
Our fallow fields now writhe with blight.<br>
Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
We have lost colour from our sight-<br>
like fools, we hold hope in our hearts.<br>
Fresh frost has visited overnight,<br>
morning shudders, barely starts.</p>

<p>Blackbirds sing from the only tree<br>
left standing on land scrubbed clean.<br>
I am watching these buildings awake<br>
as hidden beaks and wings call to light;</p>

<p>Following on from last week's <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-weaponised-nostalgia/">year in review post</a>, which was more political in nature, I thought I would take some time to reflect on last year from a personal perspective. Each year I go through the <a href="https://yearcompass.com/">Year Compass</a> as a ritual to close down the last year and set goals for the next, so this post is informed by that.</p>

<p>Another year of political chaos, with three prime ministers, war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis. It has been a lot.  Instead of returning to relative stability, the ripple effects of lockdowns have continued to have a huge impact and will likely reverberate for years to come.</p>

<p>During the second spring,<br>
gorse opened exploratory<br>
canary buds, lending<br>
a perfume of coconut<br>
to apathetic winds.</p>

<p>November rattled by. I thought I was going to read more due to the dark days and frost but actually I went to a lot of gigs and generally enjoyed myself. And here in Bristol, the frost only started in December. Here's what I did read and consume.</p>

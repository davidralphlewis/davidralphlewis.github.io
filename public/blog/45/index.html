<i><time datetime="2017-04-19T00:00:00.000Z">April 19, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>For the month of April, I have tried to write a poem a day for <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a> (National Poetry Writing Month.) It's been surprisingly difficult to find a different theme or story each day. Nevertheless, I feel the process has pushed me forward as a writer by sending me into unknown areas. It's giving me much needed rigour and discipline. I consider myself to be an amateur, with less experience in poetry than in <a href="/amberstars/">short stories</a> or plays. I only started writing poetry again <a href="/rediscovering-poetry/">last year</a>, and even then it was fairly occasional. Forcing myself to write a poem a day has been a boon, as I have tried to improve each day.</p>

<i><time datetime="2017-03-29T00:00:00.000Z">March 29, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I accidentally wrote a novel. Well, it certainly started that way. I started working on a short story in December, setting out a really basic outline and running with it. After about ten thousand words, I realised I had barely scratched the surface. Clearly, this short story was something more expansive. The story demanded a larger setting. So I continued on until finally, last weekend, I typed THE END. What was a short story has now turned into something approaching short novel length. I had very little idea what I was doing and even less of an idea on how I was doing it.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://poetryasf-ck.tumblr.com/">Poetry as Fuck</a> and <a href="http://imaginaryadvice.tumblr.com/">Imaginary Advice</a>, I spent a morning remixing* Jabberwocky* by Lewis Carrol. Because...? I'm not really sure why. Anyway, here are the results. In this first one, I replaced words with common names. Weirdly, it still makes a sort of sense:</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-03-22-distraction-by-design/">Distraction by Design: Observations on Television</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-03-22T00:00:00.000Z">March 22, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Over three years ago, I stopped watching TV. I didn't have one in the house I was in, so I just stopped. At first, it was strange to not constantly have noise and visual distraction. But soon, I didn't miss it. I preferred the silence and space to think, giving myself time to immerse myself in reading and writing. Television felt mind-numbing in comparison. I did not miss switching my brain off. In the same way as I occasionally need to <a href="/step-away-from-the-internet/">disconnect from the internet</a> to improve my attention, I never got another television because I found myself more attentive and more engaged with the world around me. As these things usually go, it soon became a pledge. I didn't need television and I could no longer understand the obsession with it. Sure, this removed me out of a lot of conversations, but I preferred the space and time not watching the box gave me.</p>

<i><time datetime="2017-03-15T00:00:00.000Z">March 15, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>Finally, after 9 months of legal battles and <a href="/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/">back and forth</a> in parliament, it looks like Article 50 is about to be triggered and the UK can start its negotiations with the EU. No going back from that point. It seems since the vote months ago that hard Brexit is now a religion, an unstoppable dogma that cannot be argued with. The UK is willing to sacrifice almost everything for the promised hard Brexit. Turn this island into a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-threatens-eu-with-tax-haven-hard-brexit-plan-ready-to-do-so-if-eu-blocks-trade-migration-deal_uk_587cbbdae4b04a8bfe6af15b">tax haven?</a> Sure, why not. Public Services? Tories were getting rid of them anyway. Even the United Kingdom itself <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/second-scottish-independence-live-referendum-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-speech-second-indy-ref-2-uk-eu-a7626746.html">is being sacrificed</a> on the pyre. It's become an absolute destination and damn the consequences.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-03-01-hope-in-the-dark-is-more-relevant-than-ever/">'Hope in the Dark' is more relevant than ever</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z">March 1, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>If you are a woolly liberal like me, someone who believes in compassion for all and the importance of civil liberties, then these are dark times. The prevalent mood, both in the UK and the USA appears to be an inward turning nationalism, a conservative rhetoric that is looking backwards to some imagined age rather than forward to the future. There's an emphasis on military spending and reducing the state. The hard-won luxuries we enjoy, such as the NHS, are continually being eroded, while at the same time the super rich refuse to pay any more tax. The gap between the rich and poor is growing. Trump is in the White House, whereas in the UK we have the authoritarian Theresa May hell bent on sending the country over a cliff. It's easy to despair and hard to see any hope.</p>

<p>If you are reading this, congratulations. You have successfully made your way into the belly of the <em>Penumbra</em>. The journey to this point has been difficult. I know, because I did it myself.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-02-08-george-saunders-and-normalisation/">George Saunders and Normalisation</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z">February 8, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>In these days of increasing insanity in the world of politics, I find myself thinking more and more about the fiction of George Saunders. He understands that humans will adapt to any situation, however bizarre and will build their identities around it, even if that situation is horrifying. Many of his characters rebel against the situations, or come to the realisation that, like Brexit or Trump, this is not normal. Since I read <em>Tenth of December</em> last year, the beautifully crafted short stories have become more and more relevant to the modern age. We seem to be living the surreal sci-fi world that Saunders created.</p>

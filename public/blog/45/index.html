<p><strong>KATIE NEWSINGTON</strong>: Welcome back. A new study suggests the moon has a more abundant mineral content than previously realised. Interesting stuff. Joining us to discuss some important questions is the author of the study, Professor Ian Boffin.</p>

<p>One of the things reading a lot of fiction teaches you is that everything we rely on in the real world is made up. We are narrative beings and we rely on the power of stories to guide our everyday lives. Very little of our experiences and the systems we live in are based on cold facts. Most of the stories we tell ourselves do no have neat structures, with a beginning, a middle and an end, but are beliefs we hold that change how we view the world.</p>

<p>I wrote a bit about the process <a href="/napowrimo-halfway-through/">halfway through</a>, but I've finally finished <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a>, where you write a poem every single day in April. I had foolishly thought the process would be relatively straightforward, but I was drastically wrong about that. Writing so many lines over so many days was a real challenge. It was difficult to keep motivated and continue writing.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-04-26-jerusalem-ambition-power-of-ideas/">Jerusalem, Ambition and the Power of Ideas</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z">April 26, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>It's taken me three and a half months, but I finally finished Alan Moore's magnum opus <em>Jerusalem</em>.  Made of a number of interlinked short stories set in Northampton, it tells the history of the town as well as the nature of life, death and time itself. It is ridiculously broad in its scope while remaining funny and down to earth, with a serious message about the abuse of the working class. The entire second book occurs whilst a child is choking on a sweet. Each chapter, especially in the last book, uses its own style. There's an epic poem, a play, a Joycean wordplay chapter. In short, it is a hugely ambitious work that in my opinion succeeds wholeheartedly.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-04-19-napowrimo-halfway-through/">NaPoWriMo Halfway through</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-04-19T00:00:00.000Z">April 19, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>For the month of April, I have tried to write a poem a day for <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a> (National Poetry Writing Month.) It's been surprisingly difficult to find a different theme or story each day. Nevertheless, I feel the process has pushed me forward as a writer by sending me into unknown areas. It's giving me much needed rigour and discipline. I consider myself to be an amateur, with less experience in poetry than in <a href="/amberstars/">short stories</a> or plays. I only started writing poetry again <a href="/rediscovering-poetry/">last year</a>, and even then it was fairly occasional. Forcing myself to write a poem a day has been a boon, as I have tried to improve each day.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2017-03-29-accidental-novel-thoughts-first-drafts/">My accidental novel: Thoughts on first drafts</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2017-03-29T00:00:00.000Z">March 29, 2017</time><br/></i>
<p>I accidentally wrote a novel. Well, it certainly started that way. I started working on a short story in December, setting out a really basic outline and running with it. After about ten thousand words, I realised I had barely scratched the surface. Clearly, this short story was something more expansive. The story demanded a larger setting. So I continued on until finally, last weekend, I typed THE END. What was a short story has now turned into something approaching short novel length. I had very little idea what I was doing and even less of an idea on how I was doing it.</p>

<p>Drains are clogged with circuit boards again.<br>
Flurries of rust flakes carpet the streets.<br>
All the air tastes of wet pennies. Every<br>
polished gear and lever is corroding fast<br>
under the pressures of time. Gutters, pipes<br>
peel off houses and droop. Children swing<br>
rivets on strings, laugh in modem screeches.<br>
Pull on your coat. Leave the Geiger counter<br>
on the kitchen side. Let's walk together,<br>
despite this antifreeze rain, feel the crunch<br>
and pop of ball bearings beneath our feet.<br>
Down in the landfill, bottles of bleach<br>
are waiting for spring to erupt and bloom.</p>

<p>I came into office<br>
<em>because in my possession was an ancient grimoire,</em><br>
at a time of great economic and international instability<br>
<em>from which a few will profit, the system working as it should.</em><br>
Families and businesses were worried about<br>
<em>being suspended over a bottomless chasm with sharp teeth;</em><br>
about how to pay their bills;<br>
<em>about flesh chewed down by ice, no help forthcoming.</em></p>

<p>September was almost entirely dedicated to wedding planning and admin. All our hard work paid off though, as the day was incredibly beautiful and full of immense happiness. I’m still overflowing from joy from the day, and had a relaxing, necessary honeymoon with my wife. It was amazing and still doesn’t feel fully real. I feel so very lucky.</p>

<p>In July I caught covid again, possibly for the third time. I'm not a fan of this illness! But it did mean I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands to consume media, so this edition is extra long.</p>

<p>Summer is here and I am wilting. This month I went out to a couple of gigs and loved it. I have missed live music, especially during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Our days are longest now, we hold the light<br>
solid between our fingers, like putty,<br>
before twirling, once more unstoppable.<br>
These are days we dream of deep in winter,<br>
when we are	banished in	eternal night.<br>
These are days suffused	with strange rare magicks,<br>
when our flame bodies flicker translucent.<br>
We manifest	what we will. Morning sparks<br>
alchemical. Our fingertips bristle.<br>
Play the music! Let us unite as one<br>
before the world tips inevitably<br>
back towards the shortening hours of sun.<br>
How precious these illuminated days.<br>
How soon, like warm embers, they start to fade.</p>

<p>After I got married at the end of September, I went on honeymoon to Croatia. It was bliss- two weeks of lying on the beach, reading books and occasionally swimming. Now of course I'm back to real life with all the admin and bills to pay.</p>

<p>I was on honeymoon in Croatia for the start of October, so I relaxed on a beach and read loads of books. It was great. It got me back into reading a lot more. Now as it gets colder all I want to do is to hunker down with good books.</p>

<p>Drains are clogged with circuit boards again.<br>
Flurries of rust flakes carpet the streets.<br>
All the air tastes of wet pennies. Every<br>
polished gear and lever is corroding fast<br>
under the pressures of time. Gutters, pipes<br>
peel off houses and droop. Children swing<br>
rivets on strings, laugh in modem screeches.<br>
Pull on your coat. Leave the Geiger counter<br>
on the kitchen side. Let's walk together,<br>
despite this antifreeze rain, feel the crunch<br>
and pop of ball bearings beneath our feet.<br>
Down in the landfill, bottles of bleach<br>
are waiting for spring to erupt and bloom.</p>

<p>I came into office<br>
<em>because in my possession was an ancient grimoire,</em><br>
at a time of great economic and international instability<br>
<em>from which a few will profit, the system working as it should.</em><br>
Families and businesses were worried about<br>
<em>being suspended over a bottomless chasm with sharp teeth;</em><br>
about how to pay their bills;<br>
<em>about flesh chewed down by ice, no help forthcoming.</em></p>

<p>September was almost entirely dedicated to wedding planning and admin. All our hard work paid off though, as the day was incredibly beautiful and full of immense happiness. I’m still overflowing from joy from the day, and had a relaxing, necessary honeymoon with my wife. It was amazing and still doesn’t feel fully real. I feel so very lucky.</p>

<p>If you are reading this on a screen<br>
your face glowing cold and blue<br>
your hand reaching out across air,<br>
put down your device. Look around.</p>

<p>Mud as a river. Mud as a theoretical concept, the transistory state of matter rarely glimpsed. Mud described in complex equations. Mud as the consequence of our actions we refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility for, despite it chewing at our shins. Mud in our boots. Mud in our hair. Mud clogging up our pores so we sweat mud. Mud turning our hills to waterslides. Mud washing away our temporary shelters. Mud as a non-Newtonian fluid we can bounce across if we hit it hard enough. Mud as the inevitable future. Mud as penance. Mud as the herald, the herald of the flood.</p>

<p>This is slightly late as I've thrown myself back into the world after a halting start to the year. I joined a gym, started going to more things and exploring the new area we live in. I also went to Birmingham and other places around the country a bit more.</p>

<p>I define myself by edges--my skin,<br>
car bonnets- but I am oh so permeable.<br>
Chest matching thumpthumpthump of potholes.<br>
Clemency lies between radio stations,<br>
in the pause before windshield wipers<br>
swish back to starting positions.<br>
Hands tapping morse on the steering wheel,<br>
messages to distant and unseen agents.<br>
My party trick is dissolving into vapour.<br>
Rumble strips and cat's eyes broadcast:<br>
&quot;Forget all you know. Unlearn your old self.<br>
A new world is forming in articulated lorry spray.<br>
Rewild your petty dreams and ambitions.&quot;<br>
Infusing clouds reach swirling fingers<br>
to stroke my embossed flesh, damp comfort.</p>

<h2> <a href="/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/">On Threads</a> </h2>
<i><time datetime="2023-07-07T00:00:00.000Z">July 7, 2023</time><br/></i>
<p>By now you would have seen there's a new social network in town. Threads is a Twitter alternative made by Meta[^1] and closely linked with Instagram. I signed up out of curiosity and almost immediately regretted it.</p>

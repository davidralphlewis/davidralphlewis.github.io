<p>because there was no danger or threat,<br>
no unwanted developments. There were no murders<br>
because we melted down our knives and guns<br>
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.<br>
War is now an archaic word, like famine<br>
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago<br>
and every person has enough to eat and drink,<br>
has all the resources and support they need<br>
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone<br>
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,<br>
but it is never unexpected and always<br>
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion<br>
or anything other difference, is a bright candle<br>
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone<br>
combined together to light up the dark.</p>

<p>Nothing grows here but sea kale<br>
and spite. We walk towards a horizon<br>
that refuses to get any closer,<br>
under the sun's pixelated glare.</p>

<p>In 2018 I was writing poems and putting erasure poems onto Instagram (much the same as today.) A small press called <em>Selcouth Station</em> approached me and asked if I wanted to make a pamphlet around those erasure poems.  After a lot of work, the result was a hybrid pamphlet called <em>Our Voices in the Chaos</em>.</p>

<p>If you are reading this on a screen<br>
your face glowing cold and blue<br>
your hand reaching out across air,<br>
put down your device. Look around.</p>

<p>Mud as a river. Mud as a theoretical concept, the transistory state of matter rarely glimpsed. Mud described in complex equations. Mud as the consequence of our actions we refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility for, despite it chewing at our shins. Mud in our boots. Mud in our hair. Mud clogging up our pores so we sweat mud. Mud turning our hills to waterslides. Mud washing away our temporary shelters. Mud as a non-Newtonian fluid we can bounce across if we hit it hard enough. Mud as the inevitable future. Mud as penance. Mud as the herald, the herald of the flood.</p>

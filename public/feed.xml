    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-06-22-Quick-Dice-Poetry-Exercise/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/&quot;&gt;creativity and &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I&#39;d write up the process in case it&#39;s useful for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roleplayingtips.com/gm-books/tiny-prep/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Prep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a way to create dungeons by rolling dice. You leave the decisions of creativity up to chance and it helps you start writing without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercise is meant to be quick, no more than 5 minutes. You just need two standard dice (d6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First pick a prompt. Roll a dice and write about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you can currently sense (see, hear, feel, taste)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random word (generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://randomwordgenerator.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; are useful.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a book at a random page and choose a phrase at random.[^1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A headline from a magazine or newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set a timer for five minutes and free write to this prompt to see what comes up, or you can try to restrain it further. Recently I&#39;ve been rolling a second dice to guide the type and form of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a haiku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a tanka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a cinquain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a sestet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a vivid description, using as much detail as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also roll another dice to set the time if you want. Can you write a sestet in a minute? Genuine question as I have no idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this exercise gives me a good starting point for a poem, something I can build on and adapt. Hope it helps you start some poems.&lt;/p&gt;

registering. How long, running for a&lt;br&gt;
lifetime? No wheezes, no stitches, no&lt;br&gt;
sweat. Pavement treadmills, that&lt;br&gt;
red car ahead suspended in&lt;br&gt;
motion. I need to catch up. Why? No&lt;br&gt;
time for questions. Legs now&lt;br&gt;
pistons, push my hazy memory of a&lt;br&gt;
body forever forward as the city&lt;br&gt;

vanishing point, never reached â€”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creativity lessons from Dungeons and Dragons</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-05-24-Creativity-lessons%20from-DnD/" />
    <updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-05-24-Creativity-lessons%20from-DnD/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I&#39;ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; as a Dungeon Master. This is the person who creates the world and encounters for the players to explore. Every session is fun and I enjoy inventing increasingly strange situations for the party to react to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst running the game, I&#39;ve learnt some lessons that are useful for any creative field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&#39;t start with a blank page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting to plan an adventure, you might find yourself blocked. It could be set in outer space, a mine, a fantasy town or any other countless situations. This complete open-ended situation may cause writers block. You may have no idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, with Dungeons and Dragons you can use existing materials to start. There&#39;s tons of adventures, a lot of them free, that can give you an initial structure to explore. I used &lt;em&gt;Lost Mines of Phandelver&lt;/em&gt; which is in the starter set when I was first playing. I adapted and changed it as I went along, ending up in a different place but using the framework as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that feels too daunting, you can start small. There&#39;s whole communities online dedicated to generating ideas for games, from monsters to taverns to towns and characters. One of the best thing that comes out of these communities is roll tables. There&#39;s a list of options, and you roll a dice to pick which one to start with, leaving the decision to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you don&#39;t know what to do in a session. You roll on a couple of tables, get goblins for monsters and a windmill as a location. Now you can get more specific. Why are the goblins in a windmill? Are they looking for something? What issues do they have? By using roll tables, it provides prompts to help you get started. You avoid the shock of the blank page. It&#39;s why I love prompts so much for poetry as well. They set you down a path and start the gears turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using a very simple roll table as a warm up for poems, I&#39;ll write about it in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ideas are cheap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these roll tables are usually available for free. There&#39;s an implicit agreement in the vast homebrew Dungeons and Dragons community that the ideas are there to be taken.  Each Dungeon Master will use the idea in a different way, depending on the people they are playing with and their world they are making. Every group of players will react to the idea differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas by themselves are not what makes the game. It&#39;s how the individuals use them, what elements they choose to emphasise,  how that idea is developed, how it is described to the players and how the idea is combined with others to make a living fantasy world. The how is much more important than the what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is useful in pretty much any creative field as well. You can have the same idea for a poem or painting as another artist, but the way you develop it will be wildly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creativity is best when it is a collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One huge mindshift in running a game is you aren&#39;t the sole storyteller. Unlike writing short stories, it&#39;s a collaboration between you and the players. They are not following a series of scenes you have planned, they have freedom to go and do what they want in the world. As such, the game is a collaboration between the Dungeon Master and the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best moments in my game have when my players did something completely unexpected, like holding the obviously evil mayor hostage or pushing cult members into a gelatinous cube. I never planned for these moments, but the game allowed for it. In the collaborative space, I am surprised and challenged in the best way, creating a better story than I would have made by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Above all, Have fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how we need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/art-is-play/&quot;&gt;more play in our artistic practise&lt;/a&gt; . Dungeons and Dragons is not a novel, or a film, it is a game. And games are fun. Ultimately, it helps to not take myself too seriously and to hold my ideas lightly. It&#39;s something I want to take forward more in my other creative work, to have fun with the work and be silly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Ritual</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-05-14-A-Ritual/" />
    <updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been unable to describe the shape&lt;br&gt;
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning&lt;br&gt;
for our forgotten winter in a language&lt;br&gt;
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky&lt;br&gt;
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,&lt;br&gt;
orange markers bleeding through the page.&lt;br&gt;
My garden whispers like a fading dream&lt;br&gt;
as thoughts transmute to smoke,&lt;br&gt;
wisp and separate and float. Recently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;too many people have died. This fog cloud&lt;br&gt;
of breath, this speaking in mist feels&lt;br&gt;
like a betrayal. Against whom I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch beech leaves sway like incense,&lt;br&gt;
invent new scripts in goose pimples,&lt;br&gt;
inhale the sharp scent of lemon balm,&lt;br&gt;
that has started to grow through patio cracks.&lt;br&gt;
Here is my hand, the pale and blotchy skin,&lt;br&gt;
the small scars from cooking mishaps&lt;br&gt;
the squat thumb. Here, it is reaching&lt;br&gt;
to hold the still warm coffee cup,&lt;br&gt;
vapours of steam like prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen. The robin and the chiff chaff&lt;br&gt;
are starting to form full sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

he spoke only in pollen drifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interrogation room the air&lt;br&gt;
was thick with drifting spores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this as being unco-operative&lt;br&gt;
the attending agent fetched freedom tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outer leaves were sliced off to start&lt;br&gt;
but vines, thick and choking, grew back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to fill the holes left behind. He smiled.&lt;br&gt;
Each visible tooth a bud about to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to dislodge the subject from the chair&lt;br&gt;
were unsuccessful as he had rooted through&lt;br&gt;
the concrete floor, sending fingers deep&lt;br&gt;
below the complex, into the vengeful soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurgent! We cried, Unpatriotic betrayer!&lt;br&gt;
but he just laughed in swallow murmurations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before expanding like alliums in May,&lt;br&gt;
growing to grab the walls with bindweed tendrils.&lt;br&gt;
Shots were fired but only blooms exploded.&lt;br&gt;
Still, he grew, shattering the one way glass,&lt;br&gt;
his smile now stretching from wall to wall,&lt;br&gt;
his hair digging into the ceiling tile cracks.&lt;br&gt;
Agents Symonds and Mikowski were lost, bodies&lt;br&gt;
converted to compost. We sealed the bomb  doors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cut off section 4A, but even now the metal buckles,&lt;br&gt;
Even now we have teams working around the clock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ready with secateurs held in shaking hands&lt;br&gt;
watching for that first suggestion of green.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Days Stack Up</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-04-12-The%20Days%20Stack%20Up/" />
    <updated>2024-04-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-04-12-The%20Days%20Stack%20Up/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was speaking to someone about journaling, and I casually mentioned I&#39;d kept a diary consistently for over ten years. As I said it, it seemed wrong, so I checked the next day. Yup. Over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed crazy to me. My journals cover my whole relationship with my wife, moving to a new city, moving out of the city, various different jobs, my whole history of writing poetry and short stories, the creation of this website, and various adventures, challenges and changes too numerous to list out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to point to any habit that has has the most impact on my life, it would be this one. The act of writing down your thoughts is a special kind of alchemy- it transmutes the vague and unknowable to concrete and actionable. It is a form of meditation where you are able to reflect on the events in your life from an outside perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journal/ diary has taken many forms over the years. For a while, I wrote everything down in the same book, then split this out into various notebooks by type; to-dos, creative work and a more traditional diary to name a few. I used Linda Barry&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/12/02/lynda-barry-syllabus-book/&quot;&gt;observation journal method&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Now days I follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq&quot;&gt;the bullet journal method&lt;/a&gt;, putting all my disparate thoughts and actions in one book, but with a little more structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has been consistent though, is the act of writing down what has happened and reflecting on it. I don&#39;t tend to write in it every day but usually every two or three. Any longer and the events become distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When procrastinating, I often watch people sharing their own journals on YouTube, to see how other people organise their thoughts on paper. Often these people espouse the importance of journaling for productivity. While this is one benefit, I would argue it&#39;s not the main one. The point is to observe how you are feeling, what has happened and the world around you from an outside perspective.  It&#39;s about sitting with the blank page, slowly filling it with messy handwriting and emptying your head. In a strange way, this allows you to be more present, as it primes you to observe the world, looking for details to write down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the blank pages become a month, become a book, become a year, become a decade. The pages and days stack up beside you, become a tower. Eventually you notice patterns in your thinking and your actions. You make changes. You adjust. You re-evaluate. But every time you are brought back to the present moment, staring down the blank page again. Each time you open the journal, you begin again. What have you done? What are you thinking about? What is right in front of you? Breathe. Observe.&lt;/p&gt;

before heavy auditorium doors&lt;br&gt;
swing open, release me in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pull up now, seeking space&lt;br&gt;
my head a dot below as I fly.&lt;br&gt;
Bald patch not as bad as I thought&lt;br&gt;
The world retreats to silence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a woman speaks in gusts and squalls&lt;br&gt;
pull the ripcord in my head&lt;br&gt;
catch an updraft, higher now,&lt;br&gt;
float in a sea of absence&lt;/p&gt;

distant panic and laughter&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When I took my mattress my duvet and their dreams</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-03-08-When-I-took-my-mattress/" />
    <updated>2024-03-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-03-08-When-I-took-my-mattress/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I said I was keeping them for safety and I almost believed it. I laid down in the middle of the nearest woodland and named it Mine. I rigged canvas between two branches but the wind whistled through my bone marrow. Waking in the night, I started a fire, using their dreams as kindling. I had plenty to spare. Still I did not sleep soundly, So I felled the ancient oaks and built a bed frame from the trunks, raising myself above the cold ground. When this failed, I chopped down every tree I could see, whittled and planed the wood to planks, transformed the land to make myself a shelter, created walls around my bed to define outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I buried more dreams beneath the floorboards for insulation, allowed them to grow mould spotted and damp. Still I did not sleep soundly. I knew that they would return for their dreams, some day soon. I imagined them all heading over the fields, a large crowd not stopped by frost or rain, for I had taken the dreams of many and named them Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one came and no one stopped me, so I declared all the surrounding land to be mine, planted thick hedges of briar and thorns and enclosed myself. The rest of their dreams I traded for gold, enough precious metal to hire men with weapons. I made them patrol my borders, watching for trespassers. Still I did not sleep soundly. My duvet felt like steel, my mattress like stone. I sent my militia into neighbouring territories to seek out those who might invade my land, take back their dreams that I hoarded.  As my army conquered and placed a flag that read Mine, my dominion grew, but never by enough. Even as my land reached beyond the horizon I felt a gnawing for what lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my long nights patrolling my palace, looking out to my silent gardens, thinking I saw the shadows move, the mob come to drag me away and demand what I had stolen from them. I chewed on the last remaining scraps of their dreams, my teeth gluing together, the bitter taste making my eyes water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to Bristol Tonic, whose prompt inspired this poem. I had a lot of fun performing it with improvised harp music.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are racing against the dying of the day&lt;br&gt;
over fields flooded with twigs and silence&lt;br&gt;
towards a broiling bruise left by a canula,&lt;br&gt;
our tinny engine whine now a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approach, the cloud swallows the sky&lt;br&gt;
becomes a mountain, navy blue, with illuminated&lt;br&gt;
golden caves. Above our heads it towers,&lt;br&gt;
an impossible island on this empty plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold our breaths close, cling to them&lt;br&gt;
like driftwood. As we drive into the dark&lt;br&gt;
rain hammers down onto our metal shell&lt;br&gt;
in a frenzy,  yearning for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three Tips to Declutter Your Life</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love performing poetry at open mics and often write poems specifically for performance. This poem is one that is written for the stage, not the page. I read at &lt;a href=&quot;https://solpoetry.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Satellite of Love&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s wonderful open mic recently and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/barryhollow&quot;&gt;Barry Hollow&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to film it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was actually made from a prompt at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/&quot;&gt;Bristol Tonic&lt;/a&gt;, which was &amp;quot;Forgotten plastic and flotsam people&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Three Tips to Declutter Your Life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, thanks for coming to this seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;m going to talk about how to declutter everything you own in three simple stages. Of course, nothing can be truly owned. Everything is rented or on loan from this world; your car, your house, your body, eventually it will all have to be paid back. Stick around though, Stage three may surprise you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gather all your plastic containers, your tupperware of various sizes with mismatching lids. Don&#39;t forget your single use wrappers, your Tesco bags and your crisp packets. Whisper all your secrets directly into the plastic, all your fears and regrets, all your feelings and mistakes and misgivings. Now you want to drive to the nearest beach - something that should be significantly easier in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to catch you up in case you didn&#39;t read the study materials, the shore is an argument between ocean and land that the waves are slowly winning. You will want to gather all your detritus, all your silly little thought loops that are now safely sealed away. Stare out at the water. Notice how your brain refuses to accept the vastness of the sea, always focuses on a small part instead- a nearby wave breaking and rumbling, the scratch of salt on your lips and fingertips, the shifting shingle slipping between your toes. Walk towards a horizon you will never reach. Throw your flotsam to the tides, donate your used memories to the waves. Plastic bags will become jellyfish drifting apart like the desiccated atoms in your body or societies faced with environmental collapse. In a fun way, I like to think of my rubbish as my greatest legacy, it will out live my skin and my species by thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sand, everything is liminal including your temporary body. I like to believe I will live forever but I hold up my hand, notice for the first time my fingers are made from wave foam. I can see veins laced with micro beads and polymer strands. The hairs on my wrists are small sticks of coral bleaching in the sun and the heat. I have nothing left to discard. I have emptied myself into the deepest trench and now float, star-fished on the surface. Churches balanced on cliffs will soon collapse. Lying in the water seems as good a place as any to observe the slow erosion of everything we have built. I untether my body, allow my limbs to drift in unseen currents towards an uncertain destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! Enjoy your new decluttered life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Manifesto for Art as Self Care</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-25-Manifesto-for-art-as-Self-Care/" />
    <updated>2024-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-25-Manifesto-for-art-as-Self-Care/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about creative &#39;rules&#39; and how arbituary they are. As it&#39;s the new year, I&#39;ve been wondering where I want to take my poetry and my creativity and have decided I want to do it for its own sake. I want to focus more on the wellbeing aspects of writing and making things rather than the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some principles for art as self care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage with a wide range of cool art from cool people. Follow your curiosity but also seek out new things and works you aren&#39;t aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share what you like and write why. If you don&#39;t like things, make private notes to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use paper for thinking and playing, use screens for editing and refining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a very small daily practise -less than five minutes. This could be a haiku or a quick sketch. Try to do it daily but don&#39;t beat yourself up if you don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe the world around you as much as possible. Concentrate on your senses. Write or sketch. Pull from these archives when stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace &lt;em&gt;what if&lt;/em&gt;. Play with ideas and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other artists have already made paths. Follow them for a while then branch off on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek collaborators and opportunities, not publicity or clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time editing and refining your work, not to get it perfect but to see what happens if you improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create for the commons. All art is an ongoing conversation, so publish with wild abandon. Remember it&#39;s no longer yours once it&#39;s been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t take comments to heart unless you trust the person and actively seek out their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>2023 in Review: Personal reflections</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-06-2023-in-review-Personal-Reflections/" />
    <updated>2024-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-06-2023-in-review-Personal-Reflections/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again I closed off last year and started the new one by filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yearcompass.com/&quot;&gt;year compass&lt;/a&gt; booklet. Although the years are arbitrary, I find this time to reflect and reset immensely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve decided to also summarise the year in a personal way, as opposed to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk//2023-in-review&quot;&gt;rants&lt;/a&gt; about politics. It&#39;s reasonably long, so strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote late last year about my desire to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/slowing-down/&quot;&gt;slow down&lt;/a&gt; a bit, reflecting it in my review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/&quot;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted a fallow year, to regroup and reflect more. For the first half of the year, I was reasonably successful. I had surgery to remove my gallbladder[^1] and as a result I needed to not do anything for a little bit. I was lucky to make a full recovery quickly, but the time off forced me to do less. Life moved on of course, and I ended up filling my time with more distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also moved to the countryside this year, which was a welcome change of pace. I&#39;m forty five minutes outside of Bristol now, which is close enough to go into work but far enough that I feel a little removed from the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter half of the year has been tough in a few ways I&#39;m not going into here, but it was healing to be surrounded by nature and to watch the seasons change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to go to lots of interesting places this year. Bilbao and San Sebastian were culinary delights, with incredible food and amazing culture. Bluedot festival was a lot of fun [^2], with science talks, comedy and excellent live music. I also spent a week in Cornwall for my wedding anniversary, watching the sea and reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some things have been a struggle, I am lucky in so many ways. I am reminded of this daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/on-submissions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I deliberately wanted to avoid submitting to journals this year. I took the pressure off myself and instead focused on writing poems. I aimed for one a week, which I didn&#39;t always hit. But that&#39;s ok, because I think I&#39;ve successfully reset my writing process, slowing down making poems and taking more time for editing. I&#39;ve also found a lot more joy and fun in the process itself. I&#39;d like to keep the attention more on the process of writing, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books23&quot;&gt;38 books&lt;/a&gt; last year, a little less than my usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Broken Earth&lt;/em&gt; trilogy by N.K. Jemisen was my clear favourite speculative series I read last year, with a wildly inventive setting and unique, well realised characters. Somehow, Jemisen manages to keep the balance between tiny moments of character and huge moments of world building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close behind was &lt;em&gt;Black Sun&lt;/em&gt; by Rebecca Roanhorse, which is a fantasy novel based on pre-Columbus American legends. It also has excellent world building and a jaw dropping ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other novels I enjoyed were &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; by Gabrielle Zevin, which is about games and the joy of collaborating with others. It avoids clichÃ© and goes in some really interesting directions. &lt;em&gt;Our Wives Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt; by Julia Armfield also avoids clichÃ©, lying somewhere between social realism and horror to create a compelling tale about grieving someone while they are still alive. &lt;em&gt;To The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt; by Virginia Woolf was a reread, but I lost myself to the beautiful music of her sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wintering&lt;/em&gt; by Katherine May was my favourite non-fiction book I read, dealing with the necessity of rest and recovering from unexpected sad times, and acknowledging and accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry wise, I loved &lt;em&gt;Deep Wheel Orcadia&lt;/em&gt;, a sci-fi novel written in verse and in Orkney dialect. It was beautiful and profound, and completely unique. I read a lot of books by Bristol poets as well, with &lt;em&gt;The Nation&#39;s Saddest Love Poems&lt;/em&gt; by Sam J. Grudgings being sad, tender and only slightly horrific. &lt;em&gt;Faulty Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Alford is a brutally honest exploration of her complicated feelings after the death of her father, with end lines that absolutely cut you deep. Finally, &lt;em&gt;Health Hireth&lt;/em&gt; by Taran Spalding Jenkins is a pamphlet of lyrical beauty that explores myth, illness and language, with poems written in Kernewek and translated back into English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think with all my reading this year the things I&#39;ve enjoyed the most have been doing something new or different, expanding the possibilities of language and story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unintentional side effect of moving to the country was I listened to a lot more new music, as my commute into the office twice a week is the perfect time to stick on an album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite album of the year was &lt;em&gt;Heavy Heavy&lt;/em&gt; by Young Fathers. It&#39;s an incredible genre hopping album full of surprises and twists and turns, sometimes rap, sometimes soul, sometimes choral unity. I was lucky enough to see them at Bluedot and it elevated the album for me, as live they are powerful and full of intense amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also listened a lot to &lt;em&gt;After the Magic&lt;/em&gt;, by Paranoul, which is intense in a different way, mixing elements of shoegaze and indie rock together to create a heady sonic mix. The production makes everything clear though and it never gets lost in the muddy sound the way some post rock stuff does. Jeff Rosenstock&#39;s album &lt;em&gt;HELLMODE&lt;/em&gt; was also a highlight, being pop punk songs about healing and improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In quieter moments, I looked to &lt;em&gt;Does Spring Hide It&#39;s Joy&lt;/em&gt;,  a two hour cello drone album by Kali Malone. I found the extended cello notes to be hypnotic and mesmerising. A late entry was King Creosote&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I DES&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful folk album about death and grief, with some dancier tracks. It&#39;s lush and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other music I enjoyed includes &lt;em&gt;Radical Romantics&lt;/em&gt; by Fever Ray, &lt;em&gt;Integrated Tech Solutions&lt;/em&gt; by Aesop Rock, &lt;em&gt;Live at Bush Hall&lt;/em&gt; by Black Country, New Road[^3] and &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; by boygenuis. It was a really good year for music and I hope to carry on listening with the same intensity. The more I explore new music, the more I find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;-  I spent a lot of this year exploring Hyrule. &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; is slower and more contemplative, whereas &lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is more frantic. Both games offer a rich open world to get lost in, full of detail and unique moments. Exploration is rewarded and you always feel like you are forging your own path. I explored almost every nook of Hyrule and enjoyed every moment of it. Truly, both games are stunning works of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also played a fair bit of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m terrible at it but it&#39;s a good social experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent quite a lot of time this year planning and running a new &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; campaign, having wrapped up a heavily modified version of &lt;em&gt;Lost Mines of Phandelver&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m the DM and its a lot of fun seeing the unexpected ways sessions turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&quot;&gt;C G P Grey&lt;/a&gt;, I like setting themes for the year instead of resolution. Last year my theme was &amp;quot;A fallow year&amp;quot;, which spoke to what I wanted to do- slow down, reassess and find joy in things. I think I was mostly sucesssful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I&#39;d like to build on that but not hermit myself away so much. I have a tendency to avoid the rest of the world, having mostly solitary hobbies like writing poems and swimming. I&#39;d like to strike a balance between resting, working on projects by myself and meeting and engaging with cool people. My theme for this year is therefore simply &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot;- with the moment, with my work, but most of all with others. If you&#39;re reading this far and you&#39;re a cool artist looking for a collaboration, drop me an email. If you&#39;re a friend, lets catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the next year is good for everyone reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: All praise must go to the team at the BRI, for their care and attention. The NHS is such a precious resource, we must fight to keep it.
[^2]: It was also very wet and muddy, but that didn&#39;t matter.
[^3]: I also saw them at Bluedot, they were also excellent. I love how they have pulled themselves out of the ashes and formed a whole new experience after their lead singer left. &lt;em&gt;Turbine/ Pigs&lt;/em&gt; is maybe my favourite song of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2023 in review: Poisoning the Well</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2023-in-review" />
    <updated>2023-12-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2023-in-review</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2023 was another year of unnecessary wars and suffering, with Russia and Ukraine rumbling on with no end in sight. Israel responded to a terrorist attack with maximum aggression against civilians, seeking vengeance against an oppressed population. It&#39;s hard to focus on the positives when the news seems so relentlessly bleak and when history repeats itself so frequently. Collectively, we never seem to learn the lessons of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a government in the UK that is failing most of it&#39;s population. Inflation has gone way up and poverty is rising. This year has also been the hottest on record and the threat of climate change is no longer an abstraction. Here in the UK, it is now a reality and an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of tackling any of these issues, or you know, leading in a crisis, we have a government who refuses to take any meaningful action. Led by an ineffective billionaire who doesn&#39;t understand the economic reality for most people in this country, this has been a year where politicians have decided to embrace the hard right. To distract attention from their lack of action, the government has attacked the most vulnerable in our society, launching attacks on immigrants, trans people and the poor. This year saw Suella Braverman call homelessness a &#39;lifestyle choice&#39;, while the government decided to demonise trans people at every turn and house asylum seekers in a barge with legionella. It&#39;s disgusting, using suffering people as scapegoats to distract from a government that is burying it&#39;s head in the sand and refusing to do anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has also decided to reverse restrictions on north sea oil drilling and signal that global warming is a woke myth. This is a major issue as the world stand at a crisis point. We need action, not denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tories know they will lose the next election because they have screwed up the economy. They are poisoning the well before they leave. Salting the earth so the conversation is moved away from any positive solutions. Theirs is a party lacking in any sort of empathy, and they are determined to corrupt everything with their hatred before they are forced out of office. Next year we need to kick the bastards out before they ruin anything more. Then we need to hold Labour accountable to be better. It&#39;s essential, not just for people who are suffering, but for the very future of our planet under climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned at the start how hard positivity is to find when the news is so bleak. But we &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; find it, we must cling to it like a life raft against everything. In &lt;em&gt;Hope in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Rebecca Solnit describes the necessity of hope against all odds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth&#39;s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Return to Me</title>

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-11-28-Return-to-Me/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, you find yourself barefoot,&lt;br&gt;
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps&lt;br&gt;
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge&lt;br&gt;
of your island, listening to my breathing,&lt;br&gt;
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle&lt;br&gt;
sigh, the dance of a million small particles&lt;br&gt;
rearranging themselves in new patterns.&lt;br&gt;
The sun is already setting, elongating&lt;br&gt;
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and&lt;br&gt;
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again. you have found your feet uncertain,&lt;br&gt;
untethered to the land you live in. You have&lt;br&gt;
been drifting like morning mist, over footpaths&lt;br&gt;
and stiles, your destination unclear. You have&lt;br&gt;
been translucent, with ill defined borders.&lt;br&gt;
So you find yourself in front of me,&lt;br&gt;
walking forwards as wind ripples your chest.&lt;br&gt;
I am cold but you stay anyway. I can feel&lt;br&gt;
each small leg hair standing surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take your burdens, the ones you have carried&lt;br&gt;
for so long now without realising. As you&lt;br&gt;
wade further in, let me hold your intrusive&lt;br&gt;
thoughts, your vague worries. Let me wash&lt;br&gt;
the soil and land from your skin. Float now.&lt;br&gt;
Lie on your back, starfished. Float.&lt;br&gt;
Forget all the regular thoughts and patterns&lt;br&gt;
you loosely define as a self. Let them drift,&lt;br&gt;
become diffuse and bob towards the horizon.&lt;br&gt;
Float now, forgetting who or where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the sun sits and light fades.&lt;br&gt;
Once again you have to pull your limbs&lt;br&gt;
together, become something like a person,&lt;br&gt;
define the boundaries of your being.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, you can&#39;t stay here forever.&lt;br&gt;
Once again, you pull on wrinkled cotton,&lt;br&gt;
shock of small scratches over skin.&lt;br&gt;
With a sigh, I regift your problems to you,&lt;br&gt;
not solved, but buffed clean and polished,&lt;br&gt;
shining smooth glass. Return to me&lt;br&gt;
with anything you wish to bring&lt;br&gt;
more into light, anything you wish to define.&lt;br&gt;
I will be waiting here, lapping the land,&lt;br&gt;
speaking in susurrations to the sandstone and the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

tungsten filaments flame out.&lt;br&gt;
Sunk in owl hoots and the scratching&lt;br&gt;
of small claws on terracotta pots,&lt;br&gt;
we feel the planet spin below our feet&lt;br&gt;
so fast there&#39;s no chance for dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particles fizzle and burn in thin&lt;br&gt;
danger, flickering bright shock&lt;br&gt;
for us sat below to wish upon-&lt;br&gt;
falling, forgotten disintegration.&lt;br&gt;
My outer limits shiver distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am cloud behind emerging stars,&lt;br&gt;
scattered galaxy visible only through&lt;br&gt;
deep darkness and quiet attention,&lt;br&gt;
diffuse yet bound together by gravity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like the meteoroids we meet yearly&lt;br&gt;
like my body, tumbling through voids&lt;br&gt;
clinging onto a small rock, only&lt;br&gt;
occasionally noticing that down is relative.&lt;/p&gt;

falls onto my crown, drifting embers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I breathe in lungfuls of wild fennel&lt;br&gt;
drifting from nearby fallow fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buzzard&#39;s shriek echoes over clover&lt;br&gt;
reclaiming every exposed inch of loam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so much time now.&lt;br&gt;
I hold it lightly in my hands,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;offer it to the churning sky,&lt;br&gt;
watch it flit away like a finch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;because there was no danger or threat,&lt;br&gt;
no unwanted developments. There were no murders&lt;br&gt;
because we melted down our knives and guns&lt;br&gt;
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.&lt;br&gt;
War is now an archaic word, like famine&lt;br&gt;
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago&lt;br&gt;
and every person has enough to eat and drink,&lt;br&gt;
has all the resources and support they need&lt;br&gt;
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone&lt;br&gt;
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,&lt;br&gt;
but it is never unexpected and always&lt;br&gt;
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion&lt;br&gt;
or anything other difference, is a bright candle&lt;br&gt;
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone&lt;br&gt;
combined together to light up the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the news anchors stood up from their desks,&lt;br&gt;
wiped off their makeup&lt;br&gt;
disconnected their ear pieces&lt;br&gt;
and wandered out of the studio&lt;br&gt;
into the peace of the forest.&lt;br&gt;
Under an emerald canopy&lt;br&gt;
they kicked off&lt;br&gt;
their sensible shoes&lt;br&gt;
and felt soil and soft moss&lt;br&gt;
between their toes&lt;br&gt;
as dappled light danced&lt;br&gt;
for joy over their skin.&lt;/p&gt;

that refuses to get any closer,&lt;br&gt;
under the sun&#39;s pixelated glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no sense of perspective,&lt;br&gt;
I almost trip over rusting cogs&lt;br&gt;
of some unidentifiable machine.&lt;br&gt;
We are watched by a power plant,&lt;br&gt;
it&#39;s polygonal bulk threatening&lt;br&gt;
to heave and shiver. The brutalist&lt;br&gt;
structure is devoid of sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have noclipped into a staging area&lt;br&gt;
where broken textures are stored&lt;br&gt;
and defragged on repeating shingle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is where the boats will land&lt;br&gt;
this glitched landscape full of errors.&lt;br&gt;
Here bodies will become headlines,&lt;br&gt;
become local gossip, become a way of life.&lt;br&gt;
And here is where people in wool suits&lt;br&gt;
will shove mothers, brothers and children&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope we get rid of this unusually cruel government soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our Voices in the Chaos- now Free</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-08-29-Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-now-Free/" />
    <updated>2023-08-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-08-29-Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-now-Free/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I was writing poems and putting erasure poems onto Instagram (much the same as today.) A small press called &lt;em&gt;Selcouth Station&lt;/em&gt; approached me and asked if I wanted to make a pamphlet around those erasure poems.  After a lot of work, the result was a hybrid pamphlet called &lt;em&gt;Our Voices in the Chaos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the blackouts I created as prompts and wove them into my poetry. Often I would use the blackout as the first lines then write underneath, but I also use used them as the last line or a line in the middle. The poems were shaped by the erasures and tended towards surreal and vaguely apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s strange reading it back now. The pamphlet was published in October 2019 and builds towards an imagined crisis. Of course, five months later we were in the middle of an actual crisis and it was nothing like the idea. The way I write poems has also changed a lot in the years since I published this pamphlet. I would do things very differently now and would probably get rid of half or more of the poems. This is necessary I think, because if you don&#39;t look back at your old work and cringe a little bit, you haven&#39;t evolved as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;em&gt;Selcouth Station&lt;/em&gt; sadly closed down in March of this year. I really appreciate them for taking a chance on a fairly new poet and for publishing my work. They put care, attention and passion into their press and were willing to go along with my hybrid experiment. I&#39;ll always be grateful for what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the press gone, I&#39;m faced with the dilemma of what to do with this pamphlet as you can no longer buy it. So I&#39;ve decided to put it here for free. You can download it, share it, remix it, do what you want with it. It&#39;s no longer my work, it&#39;s yours. No catches, no newsletter signups (unless you want to of course, go &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/5643ab85b338/dispatches-from-david-ralph-lewis&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Just a free pdf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/books/Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-free.pdf&quot;&gt;Download here&lt;/a&gt; (direct download, pdf only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;buy me a coffee&lt;/a&gt; but is by no means essential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this on a screen&lt;br&gt;
your face glowing cold and blue&lt;br&gt;
your hand reaching out across air,&lt;br&gt;
put down your device. Look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the wind rushing at your face,&lt;br&gt;
muddling and whipping your hair,&lt;br&gt;
numbing your fingertips and toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been falling for so long&lt;br&gt;
at terminal velocity it is typical now.&lt;br&gt;
You have grown acclimatised to seconds&lt;br&gt;
dropping into the nothing. You are&lt;br&gt;
rushing towards that same absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to hold onto what you can&lt;br&gt;
as you plunge. Grab moments;&lt;br&gt;
the mutating clouds of indigo,&lt;br&gt;
the emerald grass that grows and dies,&lt;br&gt;
dreams that flicker above your head&lt;br&gt;
like localised electrical storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here, even above the planet&lt;br&gt;
in the mesosphere, there is oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>As Above So Below</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;0.2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mud as a river. Mud as a theoretical concept, the transistory state of matter rarely glimpsed. Mud described in complex equations. Mud as the consequence of our actions we refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility for, despite it chewing at our shins. Mud in our boots. Mud in our hair. Mud clogging up our pores so we sweat mud. Mud turning our hills to waterslides. Mud washing away our temporary shelters. Mud as a non-Newtonian fluid we can bounce across if we hit it hard enough. Mud as the inevitable future. Mud as penance. Mud as the herald, the herald of the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;0.6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical difficulties-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe if I-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Or perhaps-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Could you-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice receedes like a hairline,&lt;br&gt;
little at first then all at once.&lt;br&gt;
The problem lies beneath the skin,&lt;br&gt;
down under a mile of compressed blue,&lt;br&gt;
where strange bodies skitter and wriggle.
where pressure will implode careless bones.&lt;br&gt;
Down there, in the dark, it is warmer.&lt;br&gt;
Only by a degree. But pressure and salinity&lt;br&gt;
are poorly understood and difficult to model.&lt;br&gt;
And there, unnoticed by passing survey ships&lt;br&gt;
or penguins, tunnels are being carved&lt;br&gt;
into the glacier like delicate incisions,&lt;br&gt;
bringing warmer water to what lies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gulf stream splutters,&lt;br&gt;
croons to us like a drunk -&lt;br&gt;
croaking, hoarse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are held captive&lt;br&gt;
by its sporading warbling&lt;br&gt;
feel its hot breath&lt;br&gt;
rattling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two morals before Rishi Sunak&lt;br&gt;
opened hundreds of lifespans&lt;br&gt;
for ommission and gasket extravagance&lt;br&gt;
in the north sea, an IT fishmonger&lt;br&gt;
founded by his fault-in-law&lt;br&gt;
signed a 1.5 billion binge death&lt;br&gt;
with enigma guilt BP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand vulnerable under artifical rain,&lt;br&gt;
enjoying the luxury of not reading headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I count everything I know for certain,&lt;br&gt;
Watch it swirl and vanish down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface of this new lake&lt;br&gt;
hundreds of worms rejoice,&lt;br&gt;
then as water keeps cascading,&lt;br&gt;
twitch as one, stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I conjure is the vertigo of ancient cliffs&lt;br&gt;
while listening to voices from the radiator,&lt;br&gt;
muffled sentences- &#39;rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb&#39;&lt;br&gt;
they murmur, a bad tv play. I clutch a hanky,&lt;br&gt;
concentrating on horizontal tree roots, the grass&lt;br&gt;
clinging to granite. I try not to think of the mold&lt;br&gt;
that grows logarithmically behind the curtains.&lt;br&gt;
My future is a distant ocean below, a grey blur.&lt;br&gt;
What is my life compared to weathered stone?&lt;br&gt;
Already my fingertips are mutating into blue calx,&lt;br&gt;
already my forehead is developing parallel stripes&lt;br&gt;
of strata. The decay inevitable, like shiny metal rods&lt;br&gt;
over thousands of years. This house will be a grey strip&lt;br&gt;
soon, our dwelling marked only by a mutated &#39;z&#39; twig&lt;br&gt;
growing in the cracks. Look, how worn the windowsill&lt;br&gt;
is already. I sigh to the silence, tracing a hexagon&lt;br&gt;
in dust. This world is not ours, it is owned by lichen,&lt;br&gt;
ours is only the shadow. We see reality in spots,&lt;br&gt;
in all those neglected corners, on the damp tassels&lt;br&gt;
of curtains. My body is indistinct, only a blur too,&lt;br&gt;
edges forgotten, bones crumbling to matchsticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and below, a cosmic bass note&lt;br&gt;
(the wheel grinding)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and distant still,&lt;br&gt;
beyond all that commotion-&lt;br&gt;
all the frantic cycles of our being,&lt;br&gt;
faint, forgotten -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the click of apertures,&lt;br&gt;
the scratch of pens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>May and June 2023 Input</title>

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-07-17-May-and-June-2023-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is slightly late as I&#39;ve thrown myself back into the world after a halting start to the year. I joined a gym, started going to more things and exploring the new area we live in. I also went to Birmingham and other places around the country a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the media I&#39;ve consumed in the past couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stone Sky&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen - I&#39;ve gushed in previous editions of this blog about the first two books. This is no exception. I think it might be my favourite series of books I&#39;ve read this year. Jemisen expands the world once again, while deepening the flawed characters and the choices they make. It&#39;s a macro and micro approach that is unlike anything else I&#39;ve ever read. There are answers to questions but they are not what you would expect, and it all finishes with a climax that genuinely could go either way. I was completely and utterly bowled over by these books. Seek them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steal Like an Artist&lt;/em&gt; by Austin Kleon- I was completing the trilogy after years. It was odd coming to this book after the other two, as I feel like I&#39;ve incorporated a lot of this advice already into my creative practice. Still, it was good to be reminded about some of the concepts, especially in a year when I&#39;m digging into my practice more. I feel like I&#39;m going to keep coming back to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M Train&lt;/em&gt; by Patti Smith- In the first chapter, Smith is challenged by a dream to write a book about nothing. So this is a chronicle of her writing in cafes, but infinitely more interesting than that sounds. It expands to cover memory and life and everything inbetween. Smith is such an inspirational artist, full of passion and reverence for the creative act. I liked it all, even the diversions into tv mysteries I haven&#39;t seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faulty Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Alford- A poetic exploration of grief that is at times funny, moving and painful. I know Josie a little through the Bristol poetry scene and this book is a fantastic evolution of their style. Each poem is pared by to just the essentials, with not an unnecessary word in them. Each final line is razor sharp and their is humour, sadness and anger mixed together. Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking Towards the Noise&lt;/em&gt; by John Bowie- Poetry written during the pandemic, with sections called mask on, mask off, mask on again. I enjoyed a lot of the descriptions and individual lines, but overall this collection didn&#39;t quite click with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Share of Night&lt;/em&gt; by Mariana Enriquez, translated by Megan McDowell- Sprawling horror novel across different times that parallels the military junta in Argentina. I liked a lot of this novel- the initial growing tension, the horror that unfolds from different perspectives and the complex, deeply flawed characters. However, I found that some parts dragged once the occult madness reveals itself, then it races too fast to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Wives Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt; by Julia Armfield- A woman returns from a submarine trip which went on too long, and her wife is trying to communicate with her. I spent the first half of this book waiting for the weirdness to kick in and missing most of the subtext of grief and illness that runs throughout it. Partly there&#39;s some inertia in the story telling, but it kicks in around the second half of the book. The ending is deeply moving, in a dreamlike way and it is beautifully written through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blades of Glory&lt;/em&gt; - A deeply silly film. Already now it seems quite dated, joining the ranks of other films in the mid 2000s that are based around a specific sport. But Will Ferrell and Jon Heder have enough comedic chops and charm to elevate it and make the most throwaway lines funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; - Wes Anderson has leant more into his style as his films go on. This is charming and of course, absolutely beautiful. For me, it felt like a collection of scenes rather than a coherent statement, especially with the framing device parts which don&#39;t add much to the film. But it&#39;s funny and unique throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson&lt;/em&gt;- We binged all three seasons of this sketch show. None of the sketches goes in the direction you expect and it&#39;s endlessly inventive and quotable. Tim picks up on small societal irks and expands them to surreal proportions. It&#39;s brevity helps as well as each episode is only 15 minutes long, so it avoids the hit and miss aspect of a lot of sketch shows. I really enjoyed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/em&gt;- Before this, I hadn&#39;t been to the theatre in a few years. This was a brilliant introduction back, which showcased what makes theatre special- the collective imagination. This production is stunning, using puppets and set changes to fullest effect. It&#39;s utterly magical at times, terrifying at others and works to bring the fantastical story to life. The acting across the board was superb- the lead actors especially acting young was impressive. What an incredible production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now, come back next time to see what I&#39;ve been enjoying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Threads</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/" />
    <updated>2023-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By now you would have seen there&#39;s a new social network in town. Threads is a Twitter alternative made by Meta[^1] and closely linked with Instagram. I signed up out of curiosity and almost immediately regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quit Twitter over a year ago because I found the signal to noise ratio to be too weak. My feed was being flooded with irrelevant information instead of people I actually follow. In the year since, I have valued quiet and going slower instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads has launched with an algorithmic feed by default and I hate it. Each constant refresh brings tons of irrelevant information from people I&#39;ve never heard off, all vying for your attention. It creates a feeling of overwhelm which I&#39;m sure will be very profitable. Opening it was like turning on a firehose of nonsense. They have taken the worst parts of Twitter and copied them wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main annoyance with an algorithmic feed is it defeats the point of social media. I want to see updates from the people I follow, not random stuff. Part of the reason I stayed on Twitter so long was the writing community, and I enjoyed seeing updates from people I followed through there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other annoyance is deeper. I think a algorithmic feed is more anxiety inducing, more frantic and less likely to bring you calm. The twitch and pull of a constantly refreshing stream of in information is overwhelming and always leads to a sense you are missing out on something. I found I&#39;ve been a lot calmer by not exposing myself to random arguments constantly and not absorbing a thousand opinions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment it seems like there is no good alternative. I don&#39;t want to shut myself off completely from the world. There are people I want to follow, events I&#39;d like to know about. Threads just isn&#39;t for me.[^2] I&#39;ll stick with Instagram, because its a bit more low and chill. Other than that, I&#39;ll continue to follow interesting people&#39;s blog and newsletters by RSS.[^3] It&#39;s a slower but more managable way of staying in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: So closely linked, I can&#39;t deactivate Threads without removing my Instagram account. How very annoying.
[^2]: Not to mention the various data sharing issues.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;They sometimes shine torches over the strata&lt;br&gt;
of compressed time, with sweeping, shaking&lt;br&gt;
hands. Eternity is present in their half smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He carries a sadness for a long dead myth&lt;br&gt;
that he longs to bury in the river far below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She longs for a bridge in the same way you&lt;br&gt;
want to win the lottery but never buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk in clouds that never quite merge.&lt;br&gt;
Unnoticed by them both, in the shadows,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a man sits at a piano and plays Debussy,&lt;br&gt;
the notes falling and fading into red dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t a climax to a Nora Ephron film.&lt;br&gt;
They avoid eye contact. Later, she will text him&lt;br&gt;
&#39;I searched for your flashlight but got lost.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night falls across the mesa like a stone&lt;br&gt;
bouncing off a cliff into the welcoming earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to the people I saw who inspired this poem. I&#39;m sure you were having a perfectly nice time in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was experimenting with consistency of images here. Not sure it fully works, but I liked some of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Personal Thoughts on Submissions</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-06-22-On-Submissions/" />
    <updated>2023-06-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-06-22-On-Submissions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent a lot of this year purposely retreating from my typical ways of writing, to try and reinvent my practise. As such I made a conscious decision not to submit to literary journals or competitions this year. While previously I have had some moderate success, I found I was basing too much of my perception of my writing on how it was received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first start writing, there&#39;s no feedback. You need external validation to progress and grow your work. Submissions to literary journals are a good way to polish and improve your craft. When I sent poems out, I would give them a final edit to try and improve them further. Make them the best they can be. Occasionally, I would get feedback which would further help improve my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was, I invested my self worth in getting accepted. Last year, I submitted to 17 places and was rejected from all of them. Rejections happen, and the best advice I&#39;ve heard is just to be resilient, to keep going and trying. But for whatever reason, I found I couldn&#39;t do that and took each polite email personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for art. Slowly, I had changed my reasons for making poems to an extrinsic motivation of journal acceptances, rather than creating art for arts sake. This is why this time off has been valuable, because it&#39;s allowed me to refocus on the intrinsic reasons for writing a poem and reassess what I think a good poem is. I&#39;ve gone back to playing more with my writing, slowing down and evaluating each rough first draft for what it is, rather than where I can submit it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the year and I&#39;m still not ready to go back. I&#39;m still trying to recalibrate my internal appreciation of what I want to write. I&#39;m enjoying throwing poems onto this blog and Instagram and forgetting about them. I might throw out a pamphlet towards the end of the year, I might not. All I know is this space has cleared the way for multiple projects I would like to create. It has been a good reminder that art can just be made for yourself and doesn&#39;t have to be published in any way at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here, under the glitter of a multi-coloured canopy I am finding a new serenity, the peace of lives measured in centuries. I am removed from glaring lights and constant haze, breathing in a million micro-organisms. My pulse no longer has the twitch and shuffle of muffled drum and bass bleeding through the wall from next door, my heartbeat settles to the pace of my slow stride. I have left behind the disarray of the city, exchanged it for the slow drowning of moss. I am stopping walking, gazing up at the branches and the distant sun, falling faster. Recently I have been too much concerned with electrical misfires inside my head, I have forgotten to watch lichen climb a felled trunk. My toes are rooting into the soil. They are sending signals into the mycellium network. It responds with a sustained hum. This long note holds me captive. I breathe out poison, nutrients for the leaves encircling me. We sway in symbiosis. My legs bend together. Merge. Time is syrup. Here is stillness. My pulse is. Slowing. To a beat. per minute. Hour. Days dropping. Dead leaves. Pile. Mulch. Regrow. My skin now. brittle. Wrinkled. Bark. What was. My name? I am. reaching. Arms. Twigs. Arms. Branches. To sky. My smile. Frozen. My blood. sap. I reach. Up. Decades. Collapse. Sky. Branches. Reach. towards. Light. Light. Light. Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stared at me, eyes covered&lt;br&gt;

by sunshade and plexiglass,&lt;br&gt;
raised a single finger towards&lt;br&gt;
the broiling, pyretic sky&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>April 2023 Input</title>

    <updated>2023-05-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-05-16-April-2023-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It feel like this year has flown by. April vanished in the blink of an eye. I enjoyed being fully recovered and starting to explore more of my new home. I also got out a bit more and did things, so reading time was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the media I consumed when I was at home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello world&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Fry- A book from 2018 about algorithms and how much they dominate our lives in different areas. I knew about some of it but a lot of this was new to me, especially in law and medicine. It feels particularly relevant five years on with the rise of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, but also already a little out of date. A good introduction to a complex subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Mutability&lt;/em&gt; by Jo Shapcott- I was aware of the title poem but had never read the full collection before. This is lush, dense poetry reflecting on the fragility of life. I loved this collection and could have highlighted the whole book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katabasis: Forking Through Memory&lt;/em&gt; by Saili Katebe - I&#39;ve known Saili from the Bristol Poetry scene for a while now but his pamphlet passed me by. I read it as part of a workshop where we all read it in silence then asked questions. The poems in this pamphlet grapple with masculinity and faith and feel intimate and personal, while inviting the reader in. It was especially interesting to me how Saili has adapted his performance style to the page, condensing and distilling his poetry. I&#39;d really recommend savouring this collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Amongst Thieves&lt;/em&gt;- I&#39;ve been running a D&amp;amp;D campaign for a year or so and this film captures the fun and chaos of the tabletop game. It&#39;s not revolutionary as a film, but everyone in it is having a lot of fun, especially Hugh Grant as the villain. It&#39;s what Marvel films want to be- breezy, funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Thousand Years of Longing&lt;/em&gt; - Tilda Swinton is a professor of narrative who accidentally uncorks a djinn and is granted three wishes. I really enjoyed this, it&#39;s a beautiful, slow meditation on the power of story to change our lives as well as a mediation on loneliness. It has some slow subtle touches and is well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polite Society&lt;/em&gt; - A delightful film that really commits to its absurd premise. Lens is getting married but her sister Ria wants to stop it. The film is told in an over the top way, with martial arts sequences and heists. It is a lot of fun throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/em&gt; series two - I loved the first season of this comedy drama and the second lives up to the hype. It expands and deepens the cast, delving into some side characters stories. Ultimately, it&#39;s a story about how a community and individuals respond to sudden loss, and how they process the trauma afterwards. One of the best tv series around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m going to try and get outside more now summer is (almost) here.&lt;/p&gt;

lighting up our motorways in sparks&lt;br&gt;

Fish is mostly off the menu now&lt;br&gt;

I barely think about my death machine&lt;br&gt;

I flex my fingers, ready to push&lt;br&gt;

I have trained for this all my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Somewhere, possibly close, the kettle boils.&lt;br&gt;
I am waiting for my insides to knit together&lt;br&gt;
around an absence, watching petals a shade&lt;br&gt;
off clouds emerge on phalanx thin branches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA is imprinted with memory, like lore.&lt;br&gt;
Most days I attempt to escape myself&lt;br&gt;
with bright lights and pleasant fictions.&lt;br&gt;
Scattered stem cells turn, united as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naming is violence, so I resist identifying&lt;br&gt;
the birds that visit daily, just watch wings&lt;br&gt;
flash egg yolk, variegated vine, shimmering&lt;br&gt;
petrol spill; collecting seeds for longer days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From waterlogged soil, from the base of a cut down&lt;br&gt;
magnolia tree, I stretch towards an ink blot sky&lt;br&gt;
stitching out of sap a fresh spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2023 March Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-04-17-2023-March-Input/" />
    <updated>2023-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-04-17-2023-March-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the first couple of weeks in March I was recovering from gallbladder surgery, so had a lot of time to read and reflect and watch things as I let my body knit itself together. (I&#39;m back to full health now.) As a result, it&#39;s been quite a rich month, with lots to recommend. Here&#39;s what I read and consumed in March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If All the World and Love Were Young&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen Sexton-A series of poems that merge Super Mario World with the story of the author&#39;s mother being treated for, and ultimately passing from, cancer. It&#39;s a beautiful collection where each poem takes the title from a Mario level, creating an odd juxtaposition. Contrasting the virtual world with the physical one is powerful throughout, and Sexton&#39;s control and play with language is beautiful. It&#39;s interesting to see a collection of poems take inspiration from a video game and is something I hope we see more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Illuminations&lt;/em&gt; by Alan Moore-A collection of short stories by the former comic book master. I loved &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;, but wasn&#39;t as enamoured with this collection. There are some stand out stories- the eponymous story is creepy and lingers for a while, where others are weaker. In the middle of this collection is a novella, which sums up Moore&#39;s feelings about the comic book industry. It will surprise no one who has followed him that he is not a fan. It&#39;s infuriating as he using characters for his mouth-piece but then also wildly entertaining as it veers into surreal situations. A mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Obelix Gate&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen - This is the second book in &lt;em&gt;The Broken Earth&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and continues the high quality. Jemisen picks up the story immediately after the first and complicates the world she has created, while deepening the characters and the situation. Tense and propulsive, this is brilliant writing that manages to be extremely strange and deeply relatable. I&#39;m reading the third book at the moment and love this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Emergency Contact Has Experienced An Emergency&lt;/em&gt; by Chen Chen - A collection of poetry that is wry and sad, often at the same time. Chen Chen feels like the successor to Frank O&#39;Hara to me, which is no bad thing. He writes from a queer Chinese perspective, with humour and joy that is refreshing and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Who Have Never Known Men&lt;/em&gt; by Jacqueline Harpman - I knew nothing about this novella going in and was blown away by it. It&#39;s a very strange book. Forty women live in a bunker and do not why they have been captured. The whole story is told from a detached, almost nihilistic perspective, and unfolds with the vividness and intensity of a waking dream. Recommended, but not an easy read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head&lt;/em&gt; by Warsan Shire - This debut poetry collection from Warsan Shire is brilliant, confident and controlled, with poems that ring in your head for days after. It also hangs together incredibly well as a collection, with poems linked by different blessings and familial history. It&#39;s a powerful exploration of refugees, immigration and also Islam from a female perspective. I read it twice in row and want to go back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anxious People&lt;/em&gt; by Fredrik Backman (translated by Neil Smith) - A rare book, full of laugh out loud moments but also humour and empathy. A bank robber takes people hostage (accidentally) and the police are trying to piece together what happens. Each character has issues which are never diminished by the plot, but explored and expanded on. It&#39;s a great exploration of anxiety, fears and what makes people tick as well as a plea for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is How You Lose the Time War&lt;/em&gt; by Amal El-Mohtar &amp;amp; Max Gladstone - Epistolary science fiction novel dealing with two rivals involved in a time war. This is richly poetic, with most of the details of the world never explicitly stated, but available in close readings. It&#39;s unique in it&#39;s writing style, rich and lush and different to anything I have read before. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Wheel Orcadia&lt;/em&gt; by Harry Josephine Giles- Another poetic science fiction novel (must be something in the air.) This is poetry written in an Orkney dialect, set on a distant space station far from the centre of the galaxy. Giles touches on issues of gender and national identity, while creating a rich world. The science fiction elements enhance the poetry, and the poetry enhances the strangeness of the situation. Giles also provides translations, sometimes merging three words together which creates a whole language of its own. This won the Hugo award and I can see why, it is completely unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akira&lt;/em&gt;- It&#39;s odd to watch this film now, because I&#39;ve seen so many other films and tv series that take direct inspiration from it. This film remains a mesmerising combination of detailed, beautiful animation and strange ideas, interspersed with overblown action scenes. There was a lot more body horror than I was expecting.  I enjoyed it but found it hard to fully engage with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Hug Me I&#39;m Scared&lt;/em&gt;- Originally a YouTube series, this is presented as a kids tv show with puppets where horror creeps in. It&#39;s weird, existential and powerful. I wondered how the short form would translate to longer episodes, but actually it gives them more chance to explore the strange world and experiment with different animation styles. Great, but maybe not one to watch when you are recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; Season 7- Our great Buffy rewatch, which has taken three years, has finally come to an end. The series finished really well, with the last few episodes being excellent. But the season is uneven, with too much time spent going over the same ground. The main villain is also pretty boring. A shame, but I have generally enjoyed rewatching &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s a show that generally seems ahead of it&#39;s time, even if some parts didn&#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daisy Jones and The Six&lt;/em&gt;- A band that was popular in the seventies and is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not based on Fleetwood Mac looks back on their heyday and why they broke up. Although this series hits a few of the rock documentary tropes, it&#39;s elevated by strong performances across the board, with each member of the band being complex and rich. The songs are also super catchy, and the musical performances are great. The series focuses on the songwriting process which feels refreshing. I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m looking forward to getting out into the world more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022-23 Winter Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-03-15-2022-23-Winter-Input/" />
    <updated>2023-03-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-03-15-2022-23-Winter-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a couple of months, but during that time Christmas has come and gone, then I&#39;ve packed to move house, moved to the countryside and prepped for minor surgery. So no wonder I haven&#39;t had time to put thoughts to paper. I&#39;m settled into our country house now and the quiet is welcome. This is what I&#39;ve put into my brain from December 2022 to the end of February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by William Shakespeare &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by  Luke Kennard- I&#39;ve never read anything quite like &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt;, which responds to each of Shakespeare&#39;s 154 sonnets with a prose poem. Oh and all the responses are set at the same house party. Sometimes Kennard comments on the language used, playfully pulling it apart , and sometimes he follows a theme to it&#39;s often absurd conclusion. Kennard threads the house party with recurring characters and motifs that come back, much like the original sonnets. I loved the fun of this collection and the surreal nature of the poems. Shakespeare&#39;s sonnets are also tonally weirder than I was expecting, often petty or jealous  and not always devotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make time&lt;/em&gt; by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky- A bit like &lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/em&gt; by Oliver Burkeman but more practical and less philosophical. This is a guide on how to do more by doing less. The central idea is you chose one thing to focus on a day, call this your highlight, then block out time to really focus undistracted on it. It&#39;s useful to restrict yourself to one highlight a day, especially in this modern world where the temptation is to try and do everything. Some of the suggestions on how to achieve this aren&#39;t practical for everyone however and it assumes a certain level of autonomy in your life and career that not everyone will have.  Useful, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical Normalisation&lt;/em&gt; by Celia A Sohaindo- I read this why I was down with a cold, which maybe why it didn&#39;t leave a huge impression on me. The poems felt technically accomplished but I didn&#39;t connect with them emotionally.  Probably more me than the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viaducts and River Views&lt;/em&gt; by Barry Hollow- I&#39;ve known Barry for a while through the Bristol poetry scene, so it was a delight to read his debut collection. I also read at his book launch, which was a real honour. These are poems rooted in specific places that are evocative and precise. Barry is excellent at experimenting with form and he plays with language artfully. Really recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How High We Go In The Dark&lt;/em&gt; by Sequoia Nagamatsu- A linked series of stories set after a global pandemic ravages the earth. All the stories have a mournful, melancholy tone as the characters attempt to grapple with the huge amount of loss. Death becomes a central part of society, with funeral houses controlling money and twisted rollercoasters being accepted as normal. I would have liked to have seen more of a variation in the various protagonists and tone of the stories, but the ideas and the way it links together are fascinating. Feels like the first modern novel I&#39;ve read that captures the feelings of the plague years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coward&lt;/em&gt; by Tim Clare- An exploration of anxiety, both scientific and personal. Tim Clare suffers from extreme anxiety and panic attacks and attempts different methods in order to cure it. There is a lot of scientific research in this book and it has a tendency to get a bit lost in the technical detail, but the descriptions of his personal experiments to cure himself are engaging. Ultimately, it&#39;s a reminder that no one size fits all cure exists for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mexican Gothic&lt;/em&gt; by Silvia Moreno-Garcia- A short novel that transplants the tropes of gothic novels to Mexico, then completely turns them upside down. It is a testament to how well the novel lays out it&#39;s clues and breadcrumbs that I didn&#39;t see the twist coming, but it made total sense. A fun, well written genre mash up, I breezed through this in a couple of days and found it really enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Season&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen- The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy. This had me absolutely gripped. Jemisen writes so well about the impossible, bringing emotion and warmth to the magical occurrences that are just part of every day life. The world is rich, strange and unlike anything I&#39;ve read before, with it&#39;s own rules and customs that you absolutely believe. At the same time, Jemisen manages to make the characters unique, interesting and flawed. I raced through this book and immediately wanted to read the others in the series. Between this and &lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt;, Jemisen is quickly becoming my favourite modern speculative author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rain&lt;/em&gt; by Don Paterson- A technically stunning series of poems with an undercurrent of despair and existential doubt. Paterson makes form and rhyme seems effortless, with a unique perspective.. At the same time, I would have liked some of the poems to loosen up just a little as something seemed to be held back across the collection. I liked it, but wasn&#39;t completely blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;- Animated Disney film about a Colombian family with magic powers and a house that is alive. There&#39;s some surreal moments mostly based around the house and some explorations of intergenerational trauma which I was not expecting. It&#39;s mostly fun and enjoyable, but the songs aren&#39;t as good as &lt;em&gt;Moana&lt;/em&gt;. It being a Disney film, the story is tied up a little too neatly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinocchio (2022, Guillermo del Toro)- I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. I generally love del Toro&#39;s films, but I found his more adult take on Pinocchio a bit lacking. The stop motion animation is beautiful, and there&#39;s a sequence set in a fascist training camp that almost justifies the film, but I found it meandering and unfocused. The plot is unable to settle on one moment for too long, rushing to the next sequence too quickly. A shame as there&#39;s some good stuff buried in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/em&gt; - Broader and sillier than the first film, this is still a delightful skewering of the ultra rich and how they think the rules don&#39;t apply to them. The cast is having a lot of fun, with Daniel Craig and Janelle Monae being standouts in a strong line up. The mystery is satisfying, if not as twisty as the first film. I&#39;d quite happily watch a whole series of these films with the only link being Benoit Blanc solving mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; - Way more fun than a film based on a theme park ride has a right to be.  It&#39;s an old school adventure film, the sort Hollywood gave up making in the mid 2000&#39;s. The CGI sequences are mostly forgettable, the plot is paper thin, but the cast are having a lot of fun, especially Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt. The script is also pretty decent, with some terrible jokes. It counts for a lot and elevates what could have been a fairly generic slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;- A 13 year old with overbearing parents turns into a giant red panda at emotional moments. It&#39;s a big old metaphor for puberty and growing up, but well done and with a core female cast that feels refreshing. The characters are unique and the story is a little predictable. As someone who was a teenager in the early 2000&#39;s, the fact that films are now starting to have nostalgia for that age feels a little strange to me, but I guess it was inevitable. Still, the animation is beautiful and the film is enjoyable, if not one of Pixar&#39;s best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;- Disney accidentally makes the best Star Wars vehicle by seemingly ignoring all the rules it had set. This doesn&#39;t really link into the main films, instead showing side characters that develop and change as the series goes on. It&#39;s about the bureaucracy and terror of fascism and when people start to resist, and as such feels way more adult and considered than anything that  was in the Star Wars saga. I was burnt out on the galaxy far, far away after &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Obi Wan&lt;/em&gt;, but this is the best thing they have made in an age. More of this approach please, using an existing framework to tell more interesting, nuanced stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to try and keep this up more regularly. I&#39;m also going to keep updating this blog with poems, erasures and whatever I feel like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sky and each moment expands&lt;br&gt;
as I observe it. I&#39;ve forgotten the season&lt;br&gt;
but the single layer of skin on my fingers&lt;br&gt;
remembers. I am an uncertain brittle being,&lt;br&gt;
standing under the galaxy, watching your sighs&lt;br&gt;
form the briefest of clouds. A distant owl calls.&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m not prey, not tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am breathing in supernova, holding your hand,&lt;br&gt;
the slightest sensation separating us.&lt;br&gt;
We look north where no city sleeps-&lt;br&gt;
spectres dance on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had almost fallen to the lure of routine,&lt;br&gt;
let another day drift into faded obsolescence.&lt;br&gt;
How easily the frail shell can fail. Soon, knives&lt;br&gt;
wielded by caring hands will slice into my stomach&lt;br&gt;
and I will thank them. A series of chances,&lt;br&gt;
circumstance and confusion has led me here&lt;br&gt;
like every crumbling second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh magnetosphere, fragile membrane protecting&lt;br&gt;
us from the void&#39;s radioactive onslaught.&lt;br&gt;
Dreams, untethered, pulse and flicker over the stars.&lt;br&gt;
My skeleton vibrates in time with the Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fly Away</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am hauling all our rugs, books,&lt;br&gt;
house plants, our glasses wrapped&lt;br&gt;
in bubble wrap and old duvets ,&lt;br&gt;
all our memories neatly boxed up,&lt;br&gt;
every object we own all jumbled,&lt;br&gt;
carrying from the borrowed van&lt;br&gt;
into our new home. I am bending&lt;br&gt;
at the knees. I am judging the structural&lt;br&gt;
stability of cardboard to ensure&lt;br&gt;
our horde will stack. Tessellation&lt;br&gt;
is essential. My shoulders radiate&lt;br&gt;
like embers. Your nerves are glowing&lt;br&gt;
filaments of thin tungsten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bone branches above our heads,&lt;br&gt;
a welcoming committee of starlings land.&lt;br&gt;
We watch the tree fill with wings.&lt;br&gt;
For a moment, there is nothing&lt;br&gt;
separating us and the murmuration,&lt;br&gt;
all the voice that sing to the dizzying blue,&lt;br&gt;
calling in one rippling, multi harmonic, chittering&lt;br&gt;
warming song that echoes and shimmers and writhes&lt;br&gt;
and separates and shimmers and echoes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take my hand. One small body leaps&lt;br&gt;
and falls upwards, soars up, up into&lt;br&gt;
the vastness. We are too heavy,&lt;br&gt;
too landlocked for flight.&lt;br&gt;
So we watch it become invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, too, is an act of devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to &lt;em&gt;Bristol Tonic&lt;/em&gt; for the chance to write something new. My prompt this time was &#39;Fly away with me&#39;, which coincided nicely with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

These words, shredded, are rich in carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I maintained the gears of the moon as a university job. On my empty days, I polished the levers, tightened the cranks and ensured there was enough oil to guarantee a smooth rise. At night, the company had a whole team on standby for the show, but during the day I was left alone with the machinery, inside a vast and echoing warehouse. My jobs did not take very long. I was a glorified security guard. Most of my shift passed in the staff room, deep under the surface, surrounded by the whirr and sigh of complex systems I could barely understand. I ate my tuna sandwiches, read terrible sci-fi novels, listened to music on my half broken walkman held together by duct tape and watched money for my studies crawl up in a ticker inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was bored, I would walk out onto the dark side of the moon. Of course, we weren&#39;t allowed near the sculpted craters, the mountains formed of foam or the ten thousand floodlights. I would hold my breath and listen to the nothing, lose myself in the expanse of grey and silence. At these times, I liked to picture myself from above, a dot, barely visible, less than a smudge, a single cell on an infinite, sterile petri dish. I always breathed out too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every poet needs at least one moon poem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 in Review: Personal Reflections</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-01-06-2022%20in%20review-Personal%20Reflections/" />
    <updated>2023-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-01-06-2022%20in%20review-Personal%20Reflections/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following on from last week&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-weaponised-nostalgia/&quot;&gt;year in review post&lt;/a&gt;, which was more political in nature, I thought I would take some time to reflect on last year from a personal perspective. Each year I go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yearcompass.com/&quot;&gt;Year Compass&lt;/a&gt; as a ritual to close down the last year and set goals for the next, so this post is informed by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also long and quite self indulgent so strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it was a mixed year. I was ill for a lot of it, with a bout of covid in the summer [^1], complications of gallstones and various miscellaneous colds.[^2] I spent a larger proportion of this year than I would like sat on the sofa doing nothing. When I wasn&#39;t feeling sorry for myself, I was very busy, a factor compounded by illness. I didn&#39;t do a great job of managing the stress and allowed it to get on top of me. The ongoing cost of living crisis didn&#39;t help either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the negative stuff out of the way. This year was also one of the happiest of my life. I got married to my partner of eight years, and the wedding was such a joyful, brilliant day. We planned it together, did almost everything ourselves and it really came together. I felt incredibly lucky to be married to my amazing wife. We got to go on a honeymoon to Croatia, which was blissful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also travelled to Porto earlier in the year. After the two years of the pandemic, the world seemed to open up for us. Returning to live music was also a blessing, especially highlighted by an all day alternative festival at the Exchange which invigorated me and made me realise how much good music is out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day job, I was also lucky to get a promotion this year, which was very welcome. I feel like I&#39;m finally making strides in my career and feel more confident with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t write or submit a lot. A lot of my creative output in 2022 was typing up old poems or finishing off old projects, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/reality-adjustments/&quot;&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt; I put out earlier this year. I didn&#39;t do much generation of new material, which is what I would like to get back to this year. But where I think I became much more confident is in performance. I was lucky enough to be asked to perform at a number of nights, including Fen Speak, Open Collab and Barry Hollow&#39;s book launch. I feel comfortable performing my nonsense on a stage to a bemused crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to sum up all the changes in a year. It seems like too long but also not long enough. But all told it was pretty good, where the world opened up more and possibilities showed themselves to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s more than I&#39;ve published about my life in a while so let&#39;s go onto my favourite media of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books2022&quot;&gt;53 books&lt;/a&gt; last year, with poetry and graphic novels bulking out that total. It&#39;s fairly low for me, as the busy-ness meant I watched more television instead of reading. I have enjoyed logging my input on this blog though, and want to continue it going forward.[^3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/em&gt; had the biggest impact on my life. It came at exactly the right time, when I was on honeymoon and wanting to take the relaxation into my life going forward. It&#39;s also affected my relationship to productivity and made me question my desire to do everything. I&#39;ve become more intentional as a result of the book and want to keep that going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite fiction last year was imaginative and unlike anything I&#39;d read before. &lt;em&gt;This One Sky Day&lt;/em&gt; by Leone Ross weaves carribean folklore with a story about grief and loss. &lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt; by N.K. Jemisin is a critique of H. P. Lovecraft and an exploration of gentrification. Both are delightful for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry wise, Basho translated by Nobuyuki Yuasa and &lt;em&gt;American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin&lt;/em&gt; by  Terrance Hayes showed me what was possible within the constraints of poetic form. Instead of being restrictive, the haiku and sonnets expand in possibilities. I also loved &lt;em&gt;The Bible II&lt;/em&gt; by Sam J. Grudging and &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by Luke Kennard, both of which are wildly inventive and push the possibilities of poetry forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/films2022&quot;&gt;26 films&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Everything, Everywhere, All At Once&lt;/em&gt; was the clear standout, a film I&#39;m still thinking about months later. It combines humour, serious family drama and existential doubt with an overall message of being kind to each other. It&#39;s fantastic and I intend to watch it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, a film that was far better than it had any right to be, surpassing the original in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other films I enjoyed were &lt;em&gt;The Sparks Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; last year. Its an incredible experience, a huge world full of detail that rewards exploration. Just under a year in and I&#39;m still finding new parts of Hyrule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of solidly listening to ambient and drone, I returned to songs with lyrics and catchy choruses. Part of this was seeing some excellent bands live, partly it is shaking off the necessary calm of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three bands that stood out to me were Martha, Fortitude Valley and Fight Milk.[^4] All their songs have insanely catchy choruses and have been in heavy rotation throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/HDilMrddajg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/rxSGFH1RD_w&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/iONqJoLfRLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really got into Sparks thanks to the documentary. Their collaboration with Franz Ferdinand, FFS, is funny, catchy and unlike anything else. Each band brings their own sensibility to the songs and the blend of voices works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/rCxLpte5loY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wanted something more sedate, I turned to Broadcast, specifically their album &lt;em&gt;Tender Buttons.&lt;/em&gt; This is beautiful, unique dream pop which somehow makes speaker interference sound calming. Sadly the singer is no longer with us, which is a shame as she had a stunning voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/z79T8CUpksE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not one for making big sweeping resolutions, preferring instead to have gradual change. I stumbled on the idea of theme years from C G P Grey recently and it describes what I&#39;ve been doing for a while- setting a course of travel, not an ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I&#39;d like to carry on slowing down. I&#39;m moving to the country soon so ethat will help, but I&#39;d like to be more intentional and build mindful moments into my life. Try to do less, not more and rewild my attention. [^5] Leaving Twitter in April last year was a good idea, but I still mind myself in a twitchy loop sometimes. I&#39;d like to move away from that and into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also going to hold off submitting to literary magazines and journals, at least for a little bit. I&#39;ve lost my way with my writing and would like to write again for myself. I&#39;ve spent the past couple of years trying to write &#39;good&#39; poems, whatever that means, so I want to reset my own expectations for my practise and rediscover what I like in my writing. I might put some more poems on this website, but I want to hold off on submissions until I&#39;ve recalibrate my own sense of worth rather than someone else&#39;s approval. Art for the sake of art basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a few other things but those are the main points. If you are still here, take twenty minutes out of your day to watch this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/jSrqC_angdc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the next year is good for you and there is joy in abundance. I wish you peace and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps Kick the Tories out please and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Third time, no fun.
[^2]: I don&#39;t know if not being around people during the pandemic has wiped out my immune system, but I feel much more susceptible.
[^3]: I will write up December 2022 shortly.
[^4]: Martha and Fortitude Valley share a couple of members but I think they are distinct enough to count separately.
[^5]: I wrote about this a bit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/slowing-down/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dark of course, but dancing shades&lt;br&gt;
that lap and swirl and churn and roil.&lt;br&gt;
Her eyes have depths she did not realise.&lt;br&gt;
No sound but the slap, clap&lt;br&gt;
of the metal hull bracing, leaping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a chewed biro she writes messages&lt;br&gt;
onto index cards, words scratched slight,&lt;br&gt;
folds in half, then again, presses the crease&lt;br&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;ooop&lt;/em&gt;- drops the paper over the side,&lt;br&gt;
bequeaths it to the care of the unknown&lt;br&gt;
and the arms of the deep forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, the ritual is complete.&lt;br&gt;
She waits for eddies to swirl reform,&lt;br&gt;
watches the outline of waves, or imagined&lt;br&gt;
waves, breathes lingering deep without realising.&lt;br&gt;
She hums half-remembered pop songs to herself&lt;br&gt;
as wooden planks heave and slue below.&lt;br&gt;
Occasionally, when the wind is wordless calm&lt;br&gt;
and she is thinking about piled dishes in the sink,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there is a reply.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Soon, they joined together in hordes&lt;br&gt;
of increasing size, shudders running over&lt;br&gt;
their bodies like waves in a storm.&lt;br&gt;
They sat together over the cenotaph,&lt;br&gt;
the shopping centre, spilled out into two&lt;br&gt;
lane roads, holding each other as their sobs&lt;br&gt;
became life rafts. Confused crowds watched,&lt;br&gt;
unwilling to leap over to understanding.&lt;br&gt;
Soon traffic stopped altogether, drivers&lt;br&gt;
unable to see through salt water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stared only at the buddleia and verbena.&lt;br&gt;
I knew they cried for the rising of the tide,&lt;br&gt;
a future washed away in cruelty and ignorance.&lt;br&gt;
Soon, I shuffled towards my air-conditioned&lt;br&gt;
office, swallowing the lump in my throat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quick Dice Poetry Exercise</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-06-22-Quick-Dice-Poetry-Exercise/" />
    <updated>2024-06-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-06-22-Quick-Dice-Poetry-Exercise/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/&quot;&gt;creativity and &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I&#39;d write up the process in case it&#39;s useful for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got this idea from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.roleplayingtips.com/gm-books/tiny-prep/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiny Prep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a way to create dungeons by rolling dice. You leave the decisions of creativity up to chance and it helps you start writing without judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This exercise is meant to be quick, no more than 5 minutes. You just need two standard dice (d6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First pick a prompt. Roll a dice and write about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you can currently sense (see, hear, feel, taste)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random word (generators like &lt;a href=&quot;https://randomwordgenerator.com/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; are useful.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A random photo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a book at a random page and choose a phrase at random.[^1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A headline from a magazine or newspaper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set a timer for five minutes and free write to this prompt to see what comes up, or you can try to restrain it further. Recently I&#39;ve been rolling a second dice to guide the type and form of writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a haiku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a tanka&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a cinquain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a sestet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a vivid description, using as much detail as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could also roll another dice to set the time if you want. Can you write a sestet in a minute? Genuine question as I have no idea!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find this exercise gives me a good starting point for a poem, something I can build on and adapt. Hope it helps you start some poems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creativity lessons from Dungeons and Dragons</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-05-24-Creativity-lessons%20from-DnD/" />
    <updated>2024-05-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-05-24-Creativity-lessons%20from-DnD/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last few years, I&#39;ve been playing &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; as a Dungeon Master. This is the person who creates the world and encounters for the players to explore. Every session is fun and I enjoy inventing increasingly strange situations for the party to react to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst running the game, I&#39;ve learnt some lessons that are useful for any creative field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&#39;t start with a blank page&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When starting to plan an adventure, you might find yourself blocked. It could be set in outer space, a mine, a fantasy town or any other countless situations. This complete open-ended situation may cause writers block. You may have no idea where to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, with Dungeons and Dragons you can use existing materials to start. There&#39;s tons of adventures, a lot of them free, that can give you an initial structure to explore. I used &lt;em&gt;Lost Mines of Phandelver&lt;/em&gt; which is in the starter set when I was first playing. I adapted and changed it as I went along, ending up in a different place but using the framework as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that feels too daunting, you can start small. There&#39;s whole communities online dedicated to generating ideas for games, from monsters to taverns to towns and characters. One of the best thing that comes out of these communities is roll tables. There&#39;s a list of options, and you roll a dice to pick which one to start with, leaving the decision to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you don&#39;t know what to do in a session. You roll on a couple of tables, get goblins for monsters and a windmill as a location. Now you can get more specific. Why are the goblins in a windmill? Are they looking for something? What issues do they have? By using roll tables, it provides prompts to help you get started. You avoid the shock of the blank page. It&#39;s why I love prompts so much for poetry as well. They set you down a path and start the gears turning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been using a very simple roll table as a warm up for poems, I&#39;ll write about it in a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ideas are cheap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these roll tables are usually available for free. There&#39;s an implicit agreement in the vast homebrew Dungeons and Dragons community that the ideas are there to be taken.  Each Dungeon Master will use the idea in a different way, depending on the people they are playing with and their world they are making. Every group of players will react to the idea differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideas by themselves are not what makes the game. It&#39;s how the individuals use them, what elements they choose to emphasise,  how that idea is developed, how it is described to the players and how the idea is combined with others to make a living fantasy world. The how is much more important than the what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this is useful in pretty much any creative field as well. You can have the same idea for a poem or painting as another artist, but the way you develop it will be wildly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creativity is best when it is a collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One huge mindshift in running a game is you aren&#39;t the sole storyteller. Unlike writing short stories, it&#39;s a collaboration between you and the players. They are not following a series of scenes you have planned, they have freedom to go and do what they want in the world. As such, the game is a collaboration between the Dungeon Master and the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the best moments in my game have when my players did something completely unexpected, like holding the obviously evil mayor hostage or pushing cult members into a gelatinous cube. I never planned for these moments, but the game allowed for it. In the collaborative space, I am surprised and challenged in the best way, creating a better story than I would have made by myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Above all, Have fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how we need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/art-is-play/&quot;&gt;more play in our artistic practise&lt;/a&gt; . Dungeons and Dragons is not a novel, or a film, it is a game. And games are fun. Ultimately, it helps to not take myself too seriously and to hold my ideas lightly. It&#39;s something I want to take forward more in my other creative work, to have fun with the work and be silly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Ritual</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been unable to describe the shape&lt;br&gt;
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning&lt;br&gt;
for our forgotten winter in a language&lt;br&gt;
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky&lt;br&gt;
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,&lt;br&gt;
orange markers bleeding through the page.&lt;br&gt;
My garden whispers like a fading dream&lt;br&gt;
as thoughts transmute to smoke,&lt;br&gt;
wisp and separate and float. Recently&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;too many people have died. This fog cloud&lt;br&gt;
of breath, this speaking in mist feels&lt;br&gt;
like a betrayal. Against whom I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch beech leaves sway like incense,&lt;br&gt;
invent new scripts in goose pimples,&lt;br&gt;
inhale the sharp scent of lemon balm,&lt;br&gt;
that has started to grow through patio cracks.&lt;br&gt;
Here is my hand, the pale and blotchy skin,&lt;br&gt;
the small scars from cooking mishaps&lt;br&gt;
the squat thumb. Here, it is reaching&lt;br&gt;
to hold the still warm coffee cup,&lt;br&gt;
vapours of steam like prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen. The robin and the chiff chaff&lt;br&gt;
are starting to form full sentences.&lt;/p&gt;

he spoke only in pollen drifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interrogation room the air&lt;br&gt;
was thick with drifting spores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking this as being unco-operative&lt;br&gt;
the attending agent fetched freedom tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outer leaves were sliced off to start&lt;br&gt;
but vines, thick and choking, grew back&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to fill the holes left behind. He smiled.&lt;br&gt;
Each visible tooth a bud about to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempts to dislodge the subject from the chair&lt;br&gt;
were unsuccessful as he had rooted through&lt;br&gt;
the concrete floor, sending fingers deep&lt;br&gt;
below the complex, into the vengeful soil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurgent! We cried, Unpatriotic betrayer!&lt;br&gt;
but he just laughed in swallow murmurations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;before expanding like alliums in May,&lt;br&gt;
growing to grab the walls with bindweed tendrils.&lt;br&gt;
Shots were fired but only blooms exploded.&lt;br&gt;
Still, he grew, shattering the one way glass,&lt;br&gt;
his smile now stretching from wall to wall,&lt;br&gt;
his hair digging into the ceiling tile cracks.&lt;br&gt;
Agents Symonds and Mikowski were lost, bodies&lt;br&gt;
converted to compost. We sealed the bomb  doors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cut off section 4A, but even now the metal buckles,&lt;br&gt;
Even now we have teams working around the clock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ready with secateurs held in shaking hands&lt;br&gt;
watching for that first suggestion of green.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Days Stack Up</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-04-12-The%20Days%20Stack%20Up/" />
    <updated>2024-04-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-04-12-The%20Days%20Stack%20Up/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was speaking to someone about journaling, and I casually mentioned I&#39;d kept a diary consistently for over ten years. As I said it, it seemed wrong, so I checked the next day. Yup. Over ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seemed crazy to me. My journals cover my whole relationship with my wife, moving to a new city, moving out of the city, various different jobs, my whole history of writing poetry and short stories, the creation of this website, and various adventures, challenges and changes too numerous to list out here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to point to any habit that has has the most impact on my life, it would be this one. The act of writing down your thoughts is a special kind of alchemy- it transmutes the vague and unknowable to concrete and actionable. It is a form of meditation where you are able to reflect on the events in your life from an outside perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My journal/ diary has taken many forms over the years. For a while, I wrote everything down in the same book, then split this out into various notebooks by type; to-dos, creative work and a more traditional diary to name a few. I used Linda Barry&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/12/02/lynda-barry-syllabus-book/&quot;&gt;observation journal method&lt;/a&gt; for a while. Now days I follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq&quot;&gt;the bullet journal method&lt;/a&gt;, putting all my disparate thoughts and actions in one book, but with a little more structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has been consistent though, is the act of writing down what has happened and reflecting on it. I don&#39;t tend to write in it every day but usually every two or three. Any longer and the events become distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When procrastinating, I often watch people sharing their own journals on YouTube, to see how other people organise their thoughts on paper. Often these people espouse the importance of journaling for productivity. While this is one benefit, I would argue it&#39;s not the main one. The point is to observe how you are feeling, what has happened and the world around you from an outside perspective.  It&#39;s about sitting with the blank page, slowly filling it with messy handwriting and emptying your head. In a strange way, this allows you to be more present, as it primes you to observe the world, looking for details to write down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually the blank pages become a month, become a book, become a year, become a decade. The pages and days stack up beside you, become a tower. Eventually you notice patterns in your thinking and your actions. You make changes. You adjust. You re-evaluate. But every time you are brought back to the present moment, staring down the blank page again. Each time you open the journal, you begin again. What have you done? What are you thinking about? What is right in front of you? Breathe. Observe.&lt;/p&gt;

I hear far below, carried upwards&lt;br&gt;
on the whistle of cold air&lt;br&gt;
before heavy auditorium doors&lt;br&gt;
swing open, release me in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pull up now, seeking space&lt;br&gt;
my head a dot below as I fly.&lt;br&gt;
Bald patch not as bad as I thought&lt;br&gt;
The world retreats to silence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a woman speaks in gusts and squalls&lt;br&gt;
pull the ripcord in my head&lt;br&gt;
catch an updraft, higher now,&lt;br&gt;
float in a sea of absence&lt;/p&gt;

distant panic and laughter&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>When I took my mattress my duvet and their dreams</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I said I was keeping them for safety and I almost believed it. I laid down in the middle of the nearest woodland and named it Mine. I rigged canvas between two branches but the wind whistled through my bone marrow. Waking in the night, I started a fire, using their dreams as kindling. I had plenty to spare. Still I did not sleep soundly, So I felled the ancient oaks and built a bed frame from the trunks, raising myself above the cold ground. When this failed, I chopped down every tree I could see, whittled and planed the wood to planks, transformed the land to make myself a shelter, created walls around my bed to define outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I buried more dreams beneath the floorboards for insulation, allowed them to grow mould spotted and damp. Still I did not sleep soundly. I knew that they would return for their dreams, some day soon. I imagined them all heading over the fields, a large crowd not stopped by frost or rain, for I had taken the dreams of many and named them Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one came and no one stopped me, so I declared all the surrounding land to be mine, planted thick hedges of briar and thorns and enclosed myself. The rest of their dreams I traded for gold, enough precious metal to hire men with weapons. I made them patrol my borders, watching for trespassers. Still I did not sleep soundly. My duvet felt like steel, my mattress like stone. I sent my militia into neighbouring territories to seek out those who might invade my land, take back their dreams that I hoarded.  As my army conquered and placed a flag that read Mine, my dominion grew, but never by enough. Even as my land reached beyond the horizon I felt a gnawing for what lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent my long nights patrolling my palace, looking out to my silent gardens, thinking I saw the shadows move, the mob come to drag me away and demand what I had stolen from them. I chewed on the last remaining scraps of their dreams, my teeth gluing together, the bitter taste making my eyes water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks as always to Bristol Tonic, whose prompt inspired this poem. I had a lot of fun performing it with improvised harp music.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are racing against the dying of the day&lt;br&gt;
over fields flooded with twigs and silence&lt;br&gt;
towards a broiling bruise left by a canula,&lt;br&gt;
our tinny engine whine now a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we approach, the cloud swallows the sky&lt;br&gt;
becomes a mountain, navy blue, with illuminated&lt;br&gt;
golden caves. Above our heads it towers,&lt;br&gt;
an impossible island on this empty plain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hold our breaths close, cling to them&lt;br&gt;
like driftwood. As we drive into the dark&lt;br&gt;
rain hammers down onto our metal shell&lt;br&gt;
in a frenzy,  yearning for destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three Tips to Declutter Your Life</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I love performing poetry at open mics and often write poems specifically for performance. This poem is one that is written for the stage, not the page. I read at &lt;a href=&quot;https://solpoetry.org.uk/&quot;&gt;Satellite of Love&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s wonderful open mic recently and &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/barryhollow&quot;&gt;Barry Hollow&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to film it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was actually made from a prompt at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/&quot;&gt;Bristol Tonic&lt;/a&gt;, which was &amp;quot;Forgotten plastic and flotsam people&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Three Tips to Declutter Your Life&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, thanks for coming to this seminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;m going to talk about how to declutter everything you own in three simple stages. Of course, nothing can be truly owned. Everything is rented or on loan from this world; your car, your house, your body, eventually it will all have to be paid back. Stick around though, Stage three may surprise you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gather all your plastic containers, your tupperware of various sizes with mismatching lids. Don&#39;t forget your single use wrappers, your Tesco bags and your crisp packets. Whisper all your secrets directly into the plastic, all your fears and regrets, all your feelings and mistakes and misgivings. Now you want to drive to the nearest beach - something that should be significantly easier in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to catch you up in case you didn&#39;t read the study materials, the shore is an argument between ocean and land that the waves are slowly winning. You will want to gather all your detritus, all your silly little thought loops that are now safely sealed away. Stare out at the water. Notice how your brain refuses to accept the vastness of the sea, always focuses on a small part instead- a nearby wave breaking and rumbling, the scratch of salt on your lips and fingertips, the shifting shingle slipping between your toes. Walk towards a horizon you will never reach. Throw your flotsam to the tides, donate your used memories to the waves. Plastic bags will become jellyfish drifting apart like the desiccated atoms in your body or societies faced with environmental collapse. In a fun way, I like to think of my rubbish as my greatest legacy, it will out live my skin and my species by thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stage 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sand, everything is liminal including your temporary body. I like to believe I will live forever but I hold up my hand, notice for the first time my fingers are made from wave foam. I can see veins laced with micro beads and polymer strands. The hairs on my wrists are small sticks of coral bleaching in the sun and the heat. I have nothing left to discard. I have emptied myself into the deepest trench and now float, star-fished on the surface. Churches balanced on cliffs will soon collapse. Lying in the water seems as good a place as any to observe the slow erosion of everything we have built. I untether my body, allow my limbs to drift in unseen currents towards an uncertain destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it! Enjoy your new decluttered life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Manifesto for Art as Self Care</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-25-Manifesto-for-art-as-Self-Care/" />
    <updated>2024-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-25-Manifesto-for-art-as-Self-Care/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about creative &#39;rules&#39; and how arbituary they are. As it&#39;s the new year, I&#39;ve been wondering where I want to take my poetry and my creativity and have decided I want to do it for its own sake. I want to focus more on the wellbeing aspects of writing and making things rather than the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some principles for art as self care:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engage with a wide range of cool art from cool people. Follow your curiosity but also seek out new things and works you aren&#39;t aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share what you like and write why. If you don&#39;t like things, make private notes to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use paper for thinking and playing, use screens for editing and refining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a very small daily practise -less than five minutes. This could be a haiku or a quick sketch. Try to do it daily but don&#39;t beat yourself up if you don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observe the world around you as much as possible. Concentrate on your senses. Write or sketch. Pull from these archives when stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace &lt;em&gt;what if&lt;/em&gt;. Play with ideas and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other artists have already made paths. Follow them for a while then branch off on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek collaborators and opportunities, not publicity or clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend some time editing and refining your work, not to get it perfect but to see what happens if you improve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create for the commons. All art is an ongoing conversation, so publish with wild abandon. Remember it&#39;s no longer yours once it&#39;s been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t take comments to heart unless you trust the person and actively seek out their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puddles erupt in sudden static bursts.&lt;br&gt;

    <title>2023 in Review: Personal reflections</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-06-2023-in-review-Personal-Reflections/" />
    <updated>2024-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2024-01-06-2023-in-review-Personal-Reflections/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again I closed off last year and started the new one by filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;https://yearcompass.com/&quot;&gt;year compass&lt;/a&gt; booklet. Although the years are arbitrary, I find this time to reflect and reset immensely valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I did &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve decided to also summarise the year in a personal way, as opposed to my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk//2023-in-review&quot;&gt;rants&lt;/a&gt; about politics. It&#39;s reasonably long, so strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote late last year about my desire to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/slowing-down/&quot;&gt;slow down&lt;/a&gt; a bit, reflecting it in my review of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/&quot;&gt;2022&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted a fallow year, to regroup and reflect more. For the first half of the year, I was reasonably successful. I had surgery to remove my gallbladder[^1] and as a result I needed to not do anything for a little bit. I was lucky to make a full recovery quickly, but the time off forced me to do less. Life moved on of course, and I ended up filling my time with more distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also moved to the countryside this year, which was a welcome change of pace. I&#39;m forty five minutes outside of Bristol now, which is close enough to go into work but far enough that I feel a little removed from the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter half of the year has been tough in a few ways I&#39;m not going into here, but it was healing to be surrounded by nature and to watch the seasons change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to go to lots of interesting places this year. Bilbao and San Sebastian were culinary delights, with incredible food and amazing culture. Bluedot festival was a lot of fun [^2], with science talks, comedy and excellent live music. I also spent a week in Cornwall for my wedding anniversary, watching the sea and reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some things have been a struggle, I am lucky in so many ways. I am reminded of this daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/on-submissions/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, I deliberately wanted to avoid submitting to journals this year. I took the pressure off myself and instead focused on writing poems. I aimed for one a week, which I didn&#39;t always hit. But that&#39;s ok, because I think I&#39;ve successfully reset my writing process, slowing down making poems and taking more time for editing. I&#39;ve also found a lot more joy and fun in the process itself. I&#39;d like to keep the attention more on the process of writing, not the end result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books23&quot;&gt;38 books&lt;/a&gt; last year, a little less than my usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Broken Earth&lt;/em&gt; trilogy by N.K. Jemisen was my clear favourite speculative series I read last year, with a wildly inventive setting and unique, well realised characters. Somehow, Jemisen manages to keep the balance between tiny moments of character and huge moments of world building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close behind was &lt;em&gt;Black Sun&lt;/em&gt; by Rebecca Roanhorse, which is a fantasy novel based on pre-Columbus American legends. It also has excellent world building and a jaw dropping ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other novels I enjoyed were &lt;em&gt;Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt; by Gabrielle Zevin, which is about games and the joy of collaborating with others. It avoids cliché and goes in some really interesting directions. &lt;em&gt;Our Wives Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt; by Julia Armfield also avoids cliché, lying somewhere between social realism and horror to create a compelling tale about grieving someone while they are still alive. &lt;em&gt;To The Lighthouse&lt;/em&gt; by Virginia Woolf was a reread, but I lost myself to the beautiful music of her sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wintering&lt;/em&gt; by Katherine May was my favourite non-fiction book I read, dealing with the necessity of rest and recovering from unexpected sad times, and acknowledging and accepting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry wise, I loved &lt;em&gt;Deep Wheel Orcadia&lt;/em&gt;, a sci-fi novel written in verse and in Orkney dialect. It was beautiful and profound, and completely unique. I read a lot of books by Bristol poets as well, with &lt;em&gt;The Nation&#39;s Saddest Love Poems&lt;/em&gt; by Sam J. Grudgings being sad, tender and only slightly horrific. &lt;em&gt;Faulty Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Alford is a brutally honest exploration of her complicated feelings after the death of her father, with end lines that absolutely cut you deep. Finally, &lt;em&gt;Health Hireth&lt;/em&gt; by Taran Spalding Jenkins is a pamphlet of lyrical beauty that explores myth, illness and language, with poems written in Kernewek and translated back into English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think with all my reading this year the things I&#39;ve enjoyed the most have been doing something new or different, expanding the possibilities of language and story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unintentional side effect of moving to the country was I listened to a lot more new music, as my commute into the office twice a week is the perfect time to stick on an album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite album of the year was &lt;em&gt;Heavy Heavy&lt;/em&gt; by Young Fathers. It&#39;s an incredible genre hopping album full of surprises and twists and turns, sometimes rap, sometimes soul, sometimes choral unity. I was lucky enough to see them at Bluedot and it elevated the album for me, as live they are powerful and full of intense amounts of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also listened a lot to &lt;em&gt;After the Magic&lt;/em&gt;, by Paranoul, which is intense in a different way, mixing elements of shoegaze and indie rock together to create a heady sonic mix. The production makes everything clear though and it never gets lost in the muddy sound the way some post rock stuff does. Jeff Rosenstock&#39;s album &lt;em&gt;HELLMODE&lt;/em&gt; was also a highlight, being pop punk songs about healing and improving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In quieter moments, I looked to &lt;em&gt;Does Spring Hide It&#39;s Joy&lt;/em&gt;,  a two hour cello drone album by Kali Malone. I found the extended cello notes to be hypnotic and mesmerising. A late entry was King Creosote&#39;s &lt;em&gt;I DES&lt;/em&gt;, a beautiful folk album about death and grief, with some dancier tracks. It&#39;s lush and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other music I enjoyed includes &lt;em&gt;Radical Romantics&lt;/em&gt; by Fever Ray, &lt;em&gt;Integrated Tech Solutions&lt;/em&gt; by Aesop Rock, &lt;em&gt;Live at Bush Hall&lt;/em&gt; by Black Country, New Road[^3] and &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; by boygenuis. It was a really good year for music and I hope to carry on listening with the same intensity. The more I explore new music, the more I find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;-  I spent a lot of this year exploring Hyrule. &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; is slower and more contemplative, whereas &lt;em&gt;Tears of the Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; is more frantic. Both games offer a rich open world to get lost in, full of detail and unique moments. Exploration is rewarded and you always feel like you are forging your own path. I explored almost every nook of Hyrule and enjoyed every moment of it. Truly, both games are stunning works of art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also played a fair bit of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m terrible at it but it&#39;s a good social experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent quite a lot of time this year planning and running a new &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; campaign, having wrapped up a heavily modified version of &lt;em&gt;Lost Mines of Phandelver&lt;/em&gt;. I&#39;m the DM and its a lot of fun seeing the unexpected ways sessions turn out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE&quot;&gt;C G P Grey&lt;/a&gt;, I like setting themes for the year instead of resolution. Last year my theme was &amp;quot;A fallow year&amp;quot;, which spoke to what I wanted to do- slow down, reassess and find joy in things. I think I was mostly sucesssful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I&#39;d like to build on that but not hermit myself away so much. I have a tendency to avoid the rest of the world, having mostly solitary hobbies like writing poems and swimming. I&#39;d like to strike a balance between resting, working on projects by myself and meeting and engaging with cool people. My theme for this year is therefore simply &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot;- with the moment, with my work, but most of all with others. If you&#39;re reading this far and you&#39;re a cool artist looking for a collaboration, drop me an email. If you&#39;re a friend, lets catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the next year is good for everyone reading this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: All praise must go to the team at the BRI, for their care and attention. The NHS is such a precious resource, we must fight to keep it.
[^2]: It was also very wet and muddy, but that didn&#39;t matter.
[^3]: I also saw them at Bluedot, they were also excellent. I love how they have pulled themselves out of the ashes and formed a whole new experience after their lead singer left. &lt;em&gt;Turbine/ Pigs&lt;/em&gt; is maybe my favourite song of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;2023 was another year of unnecessary wars and suffering, with Russia and Ukraine rumbling on with no end in sight. Israel responded to a terrorist attack with maximum aggression against civilians, seeking vengeance against an oppressed population. It&#39;s hard to focus on the positives when the news seems so relentlessly bleak and when history repeats itself so frequently. Collectively, we never seem to learn the lessons of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a government in the UK that is failing most of it&#39;s population. Inflation has gone way up and poverty is rising. This year has also been the hottest on record and the threat of climate change is no longer an abstraction. Here in the UK, it is now a reality and an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of tackling any of these issues, or you know, leading in a crisis, we have a government who refuses to take any meaningful action. Led by an ineffective billionaire who doesn&#39;t understand the economic reality for most people in this country, this has been a year where politicians have decided to embrace the hard right. To distract attention from their lack of action, the government has attacked the most vulnerable in our society, launching attacks on immigrants, trans people and the poor. This year saw Suella Braverman call homelessness a &#39;lifestyle choice&#39;, while the government decided to demonise trans people at every turn and house asylum seekers in a barge with legionella. It&#39;s disgusting, using suffering people as scapegoats to distract from a government that is burying it&#39;s head in the sand and refusing to do anything meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has also decided to reverse restrictions on north sea oil drilling and signal that global warming is a woke myth. This is a major issue as the world stand at a crisis point. We need action, not denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tories know they will lose the next election because they have screwed up the economy. They are poisoning the well before they leave. Salting the earth so the conversation is moved away from any positive solutions. Theirs is a party lacking in any sort of empathy, and they are determined to corrupt everything with their hatred before they are forced out of office. Next year we need to kick the bastards out before they ruin anything more. Then we need to hold Labour accountable to be better. It&#39;s essential, not just for people who are suffering, but for the very future of our planet under climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned at the start how hard positivity is to find when the news is so bleak. But we &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; find it, we must cling to it like a life raft against everything. In &lt;em&gt;Hope in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;, Rebecca Solnit describes the necessity of hope against all odds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... hope is an ax you break down doors with in an emergency; because hope should shove you out the door, because it will take everything you have to steer the future away from endless war, from the annihilation of the earth&#39;s treasures and the grinding down of the poor and marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t think of anything more necessary and relevant as we head into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-11-28-Return-to-Me/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, you find yourself barefoot,&lt;br&gt;
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps&lt;br&gt;
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge&lt;br&gt;
of your island, listening to my breathing,&lt;br&gt;
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle&lt;br&gt;
sigh, the dance of a million small particles&lt;br&gt;
rearranging themselves in new patterns.&lt;br&gt;
The sun is already setting, elongating&lt;br&gt;
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and&lt;br&gt;
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again. you have found your feet uncertain,&lt;br&gt;
untethered to the land you live in. You have&lt;br&gt;
been drifting like morning mist, over footpaths&lt;br&gt;
and stiles, your destination unclear. You have&lt;br&gt;
been translucent, with ill defined borders.&lt;br&gt;
So you find yourself in front of me,&lt;br&gt;
walking forwards as wind ripples your chest.&lt;br&gt;
I am cold but you stay anyway. I can feel&lt;br&gt;
each small leg hair standing surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me take your burdens, the ones you have carried&lt;br&gt;
for so long now without realising. As you&lt;br&gt;
wade further in, let me hold your intrusive&lt;br&gt;
thoughts, your vague worries. Let me wash&lt;br&gt;
the soil and land from your skin. Float now.&lt;br&gt;
Lie on your back, starfished. Float.&lt;br&gt;
Forget all the regular thoughts and patterns&lt;br&gt;
you loosely define as a self. Let them drift,&lt;br&gt;
become diffuse and bob towards the horizon.&lt;br&gt;
Float now, forgetting who or where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again the sun sits and light fades.&lt;br&gt;
Once again you have to pull your limbs&lt;br&gt;
together, become something like a person,&lt;br&gt;
define the boundaries of your being.&lt;br&gt;
Of course, you can&#39;t stay here forever.&lt;br&gt;
Once again, you pull on wrinkled cotton,&lt;br&gt;
shock of small scratches over skin.&lt;br&gt;
With a sigh, I regift your problems to you,&lt;br&gt;
not solved, but buffed clean and polished,&lt;br&gt;
shining smooth glass. Return to me&lt;br&gt;
with anything you wish to bring&lt;br&gt;
more into light, anything you wish to define.&lt;br&gt;
I will be waiting here, lapping the land,&lt;br&gt;
speaking in susurrations to the sandstone and the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

tungsten filaments flame out.&lt;br&gt;
Sunk in owl hoots and the scratching&lt;br&gt;
of small claws on terracotta pots,&lt;br&gt;
we feel the planet spin below our feet&lt;br&gt;
so fast there&#39;s no chance for dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Particles fizzle and burn in thin&lt;br&gt;
danger, flickering bright shock&lt;br&gt;
for us sat below to wish upon-&lt;br&gt;
falling, forgotten disintegration.&lt;br&gt;
My outer limits shiver distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am cloud behind emerging stars,&lt;br&gt;
scattered galaxy visible only through&lt;br&gt;
deep darkness and quiet attention,&lt;br&gt;
diffuse yet bound together by gravity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;like the meteoroids we meet yearly&lt;br&gt;
like my body, tumbling through voids&lt;br&gt;
clinging onto a small rock, only&lt;br&gt;
occasionally noticing that down is relative.&lt;/p&gt;

falls onto my crown, drifting embers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I breathe in lungfuls of wild fennel&lt;br&gt;
drifting from nearby fallow fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buzzard&#39;s shriek echoes over clover&lt;br&gt;
reclaiming every exposed inch of loam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have so much time now.&lt;br&gt;
I hold it lightly in my hands,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;offer it to the churning sky,&lt;br&gt;
watch it flit away like a finch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;because there was no danger or threat,&lt;br&gt;
no unwanted developments. There were no murders&lt;br&gt;
because we melted down our knives and guns&lt;br&gt;
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.&lt;br&gt;
War is now an archaic word, like famine&lt;br&gt;
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago&lt;br&gt;
and every person has enough to eat and drink,&lt;br&gt;
has all the resources and support they need&lt;br&gt;
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone&lt;br&gt;
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,&lt;br&gt;
but it is never unexpected and always&lt;br&gt;
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion&lt;br&gt;
or anything other difference, is a bright candle&lt;br&gt;
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone&lt;br&gt;
combined together to light up the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the news anchors stood up from their desks,&lt;br&gt;
wiped off their makeup&lt;br&gt;
disconnected their ear pieces&lt;br&gt;
and wandered out of the studio&lt;br&gt;
into the peace of the forest.&lt;br&gt;
Under an emerald canopy&lt;br&gt;
they kicked off&lt;br&gt;
their sensible shoes&lt;br&gt;
and felt soil and soft moss&lt;br&gt;
between their toes&lt;br&gt;
as dappled light danced&lt;br&gt;
for joy over their skin.&lt;/p&gt;

that refuses to get any closer,&lt;br&gt;
under the sun&#39;s pixelated glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having no sense of perspective,&lt;br&gt;
I almost trip over rusting cogs&lt;br&gt;
of some unidentifiable machine.&lt;br&gt;
We are watched by a power plant,&lt;br&gt;
it&#39;s polygonal bulk threatening&lt;br&gt;
to heave and shiver. The brutalist&lt;br&gt;
structure is devoid of sound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have noclipped into a staging area&lt;br&gt;
where broken textures are stored&lt;br&gt;
and defragged on repeating shingle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is where the boats will land&lt;br&gt;
this glitched landscape full of errors.&lt;br&gt;
Here bodies will become headlines,&lt;br&gt;
become local gossip, become a way of life.&lt;br&gt;
And here is where people in wool suits&lt;br&gt;
will shove mothers, brothers and children&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really hope we get rid of this unusually cruel government soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our Voices in the Chaos- now Free</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-08-29-Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-now-Free/" />
    <updated>2023-08-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-08-29-Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-now-Free/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I was writing poems and putting erasure poems onto Instagram (much the same as today.) A small press called &lt;em&gt;Selcouth Station&lt;/em&gt; approached me and asked if I wanted to make a pamphlet around those erasure poems.  After a lot of work, the result was a hybrid pamphlet called &lt;em&gt;Our Voices in the Chaos&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the blackouts I created as prompts and wove them into my poetry. Often I would use the blackout as the first lines then write underneath, but I also use used them as the last line or a line in the middle. The poems were shaped by the erasures and tended towards surreal and vaguely apocalyptic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s strange reading it back now. The pamphlet was published in October 2019 and builds towards an imagined crisis. Of course, five months later we were in the middle of an actual crisis and it was nothing like the idea. The way I write poems has also changed a lot in the years since I published this pamphlet. I would do things very differently now and would probably get rid of half or more of the poems. This is necessary I think, because if you don&#39;t look back at your old work and cringe a little bit, you haven&#39;t evolved as an artist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;em&gt;Selcouth Station&lt;/em&gt; sadly closed down in March of this year. I really appreciate them for taking a chance on a fairly new poet and for publishing my work. They put care, attention and passion into their press and were willing to go along with my hybrid experiment. I&#39;ll always be grateful for what they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the press gone, I&#39;m faced with the dilemma of what to do with this pamphlet as you can no longer buy it. So I&#39;ve decided to put it here for free. You can download it, share it, remix it, do what you want with it. It&#39;s no longer my work, it&#39;s yours. No catches, no newsletter signups (unless you want to of course, go &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/5643ab85b338/dispatches-from-david-ralph-lewis&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Just a free pdf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/books/Our-Voices-in-the-Chaos-free.pdf&quot;&gt;Download here&lt;/a&gt; (direct download, pdf only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;buy me a coffee&lt;/a&gt; but is by no means essential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this on a screen&lt;br&gt;
your face glowing cold and blue&lt;br&gt;
your hand reaching out across air,&lt;br&gt;
put down your device. Look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the wind rushing at your face,&lt;br&gt;
muddling and whipping your hair,&lt;br&gt;
numbing your fingertips and toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been falling for so long&lt;br&gt;
at terminal velocity it is typical now.&lt;br&gt;
You have grown acclimatised to seconds&lt;br&gt;
dropping into the nothing. You are&lt;br&gt;
rushing towards that same absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to hold onto what you can&lt;br&gt;
as you plunge. Grab moments;&lt;br&gt;
the mutating clouds of indigo,&lt;br&gt;
the emerald grass that grows and dies,&lt;br&gt;
dreams that flicker above your head&lt;br&gt;
like localised electrical storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here, even above the planet&lt;br&gt;
in the mesosphere, there is oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breathe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;0.2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mud as a river. Mud as a theoretical concept, the transistory state of matter rarely glimpsed. Mud described in complex equations. Mud as the consequence of our actions we refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility for, despite it chewing at our shins. Mud in our boots. Mud in our hair. Mud clogging up our pores so we sweat mud. Mud turning our hills to waterslides. Mud washing away our temporary shelters. Mud as a non-Newtonian fluid we can bounce across if we hit it hard enough. Mud as the inevitable future. Mud as penance. Mud as the herald, the herald of the flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;0.6&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical difficulties-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Maybe if I-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Or perhaps-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;br&gt;
Could you-&lt;br&gt;
Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ice receedes like a hairline,&lt;br&gt;
little at first then all at once.&lt;br&gt;
The problem lies beneath the skin,&lt;br&gt;
down under a mile of compressed blue,&lt;br&gt;
where strange bodies skitter and wriggle.
where pressure will implode careless bones.&lt;br&gt;
Down there, in the dark, it is warmer.&lt;br&gt;
Only by a degree. But pressure and salinity&lt;br&gt;
are poorly understood and difficult to model.&lt;br&gt;
And there, unnoticed by passing survey ships&lt;br&gt;
or penguins, tunnels are being carved&lt;br&gt;
into the glacier like delicate incisions,&lt;br&gt;
bringing warmer water to what lies above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1.7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gulf stream splutters,&lt;br&gt;
croons to us like a drunk -&lt;br&gt;
croaking, hoarse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are held captive&lt;br&gt;
by its sporading warbling&lt;br&gt;
feel its hot breath&lt;br&gt;
rattling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2.5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just two morals before Rishi Sunak&lt;br&gt;
opened hundreds of lifespans&lt;br&gt;
for ommission and gasket extravagance&lt;br&gt;
in the north sea, an IT fishmonger&lt;br&gt;
founded by his fault-in-law&lt;br&gt;
signed a 1.5 billion binge death&lt;br&gt;
with enigma guilt BP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3.2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stand vulnerable under artifical rain,&lt;br&gt;
enjoying the luxury of not reading headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I count everything I know for certain,&lt;br&gt;
Watch it swirl and vanish down the drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4.0&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the surface of this new lake&lt;br&gt;
hundreds of worms rejoice,&lt;br&gt;
then as water keeps cascading,&lt;br&gt;
twitch as one, stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;

that grows logarithmically behind the curtains.&lt;br&gt;
My future is a distant ocean below, a grey blur.&lt;br&gt;
What is my life compared to weathered stone?&lt;br&gt;
Already my fingertips are mutating into blue calx,&lt;br&gt;
already my forehead is developing parallel stripes&lt;br&gt;
of strata. The decay inevitable, like shiny metal rods&lt;br&gt;
over thousands of years. This house will be a grey strip&lt;br&gt;
soon, our dwelling marked only by a mutated &#39;z&#39; twig&lt;br&gt;
growing in the cracks. Look, how worn the windowsill&lt;br&gt;
is already. I sigh to the silence, tracing a hexagon&lt;br&gt;
in dust. This world is not ours, it is owned by lichen,&lt;br&gt;
ours is only the shadow. We see reality in spots,&lt;br&gt;
in all those neglected corners, on the damp tassels&lt;br&gt;
of curtains. My body is indistinct, only a blur too,&lt;br&gt;
edges forgotten, bones crumbling to matchsticks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is slightly late as I&#39;ve thrown myself back into the world after a halting start to the year. I joined a gym, started going to more things and exploring the new area we live in. I also went to Birmingham and other places around the country a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the media I&#39;ve consumed in the past couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stone Sky&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen - I&#39;ve gushed in previous editions of this blog about the first two books. This is no exception. I think it might be my favourite series of books I&#39;ve read this year. Jemisen expands the world once again, while deepening the flawed characters and the choices they make. It&#39;s a macro and micro approach that is unlike anything else I&#39;ve ever read. There are answers to questions but they are not what you would expect, and it all finishes with a climax that genuinely could go either way. I was completely and utterly bowled over by these books. Seek them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steal Like an Artist&lt;/em&gt; by Austin Kleon- I was completing the trilogy after years. It was odd coming to this book after the other two, as I feel like I&#39;ve incorporated a lot of this advice already into my creative practice. Still, it was good to be reminded about some of the concepts, especially in a year when I&#39;m digging into my practice more. I feel like I&#39;m going to keep coming back to this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;M Train&lt;/em&gt; by Patti Smith- In the first chapter, Smith is challenged by a dream to write a book about nothing. So this is a chronicle of her writing in cafes, but infinitely more interesting than that sounds. It expands to cover memory and life and everything inbetween. Smith is such an inspirational artist, full of passion and reverence for the creative act. I liked it all, even the diversions into tv mysteries I haven&#39;t seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faulty Manufacturing&lt;/em&gt; by Josie Alford- A poetic exploration of grief that is at times funny, moving and painful. I know Josie a little through the Bristol poetry scene and this book is a fantastic evolution of their style. Each poem is pared by to just the essentials, with not an unnecessary word in them. Each final line is razor sharp and their is humour, sadness and anger mixed together. Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking Towards the Noise&lt;/em&gt; by John Bowie- Poetry written during the pandemic, with sections called mask on, mask off, mask on again. I enjoyed a lot of the descriptions and individual lines, but overall this collection didn&#39;t quite click with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Share of Night&lt;/em&gt; by Mariana Enriquez, translated by Megan McDowell- Sprawling horror novel across different times that parallels the military junta in Argentina. I liked a lot of this novel- the initial growing tension, the horror that unfolds from different perspectives and the complex, deeply flawed characters. However, I found that some parts dragged once the occult madness reveals itself, then it races too fast to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Wives Under the Sea&lt;/em&gt; by Julia Armfield- A woman returns from a submarine trip which went on too long, and her wife is trying to communicate with her. I spent the first half of this book waiting for the weirdness to kick in and missing most of the subtext of grief and illness that runs throughout it. Partly there&#39;s some inertia in the story telling, but it kicks in around the second half of the book. The ending is deeply moving, in a dreamlike way and it is beautifully written through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blades of Glory&lt;/em&gt; - A deeply silly film. Already now it seems quite dated, joining the ranks of other films in the mid 2000s that are based around a specific sport. But Will Ferrell and Jon Heder have enough comedic chops and charm to elevate it and make the most throwaway lines funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asteroid City&lt;/em&gt; - Wes Anderson has leant more into his style as his films go on. This is charming and of course, absolutely beautiful. For me, it felt like a collection of scenes rather than a coherent statement, especially with the framing device parts which don&#39;t add much to the film. But it&#39;s funny and unique throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Think You Should Leave with Tim Robinson&lt;/em&gt;- We binged all three seasons of this sketch show. None of the sketches goes in the direction you expect and it&#39;s endlessly inventive and quotable. Tim picks up on small societal irks and expands them to surreal proportions. It&#39;s brevity helps as well as each episode is only 15 minutes long, so it avoids the hit and miss aspect of a lot of sketch shows. I really enjoyed it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Theatre&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&lt;/em&gt;- Before this, I hadn&#39;t been to the theatre in a few years. This was a brilliant introduction back, which showcased what makes theatre special- the collective imagination. This production is stunning, using puppets and set changes to fullest effect. It&#39;s utterly magical at times, terrifying at others and works to bring the fantastical story to life. The acting across the board was superb- the lead actors especially acting young was impressive. What an incredible production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now, come back next time to see what I&#39;ve been enjoying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On Threads</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/" />
    <updated>2023-07-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-07-07-On-Threads/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;By now you would have seen there&#39;s a new social network in town. Threads is a Twitter alternative made by Meta[^1] and closely linked with Instagram. I signed up out of curiosity and almost immediately regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quit Twitter over a year ago because I found the signal to noise ratio to be too weak. My feed was being flooded with irrelevant information instead of people I actually follow. In the year since, I have valued quiet and going slower instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threads has launched with an algorithmic feed by default and I hate it. Each constant refresh brings tons of irrelevant information from people I&#39;ve never heard off, all vying for your attention. It creates a feeling of overwhelm which I&#39;m sure will be very profitable. Opening it was like turning on a firehose of nonsense. They have taken the worst parts of Twitter and copied them wholesale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main annoyance with an algorithmic feed is it defeats the point of social media. I want to see updates from the people I follow, not random stuff. Part of the reason I stayed on Twitter so long was the writing community, and I enjoyed seeing updates from people I followed through there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My other annoyance is deeper. I think a algorithmic feed is more anxiety inducing, more frantic and less likely to bring you calm. The twitch and pull of a constantly refreshing stream of in information is overwhelming and always leads to a sense you are missing out on something. I found I&#39;ve been a lot calmer by not exposing myself to random arguments constantly and not absorbing a thousand opinions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment it seems like there is no good alternative. I don&#39;t want to shut myself off completely from the world. There are people I want to follow, events I&#39;d like to know about. Threads just isn&#39;t for me.[^2] I&#39;ll stick with Instagram, because its a bit more low and chill. Other than that, I&#39;ll continue to follow interesting people&#39;s blog and newsletters by RSS.[^3] It&#39;s a slower but more managable way of staying in touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: So closely linked, I can&#39;t deactivate Threads without removing my Instagram account. How very annoying.
[^2]: Not to mention the various data sharing issues.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;They sometimes shine torches over the strata&lt;br&gt;
of compressed time, with sweeping, shaking&lt;br&gt;
hands. Eternity is present in their half smiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He carries a sadness for a long dead myth&lt;br&gt;
that he longs to bury in the river far below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She longs for a bridge in the same way you&lt;br&gt;
want to win the lottery but never buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They talk in clouds that never quite merge.&lt;br&gt;
Unnoticed by them both, in the shadows,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a man sits at a piano and plays Debussy,&lt;br&gt;
the notes falling and fading into red dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t a climax to a Nora Ephron film.&lt;br&gt;
They avoid eye contact. Later, she will text him&lt;br&gt;
&#39;I searched for your flashlight but got lost.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night falls across the mesa like a stone&lt;br&gt;
bouncing off a cliff into the welcoming earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to the people I saw who inspired this poem. I&#39;m sure you were having a perfectly nice time in reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was experimenting with consistency of images here. Not sure it fully works, but I liked some of the lines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Personal Thoughts on Submissions</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-06-22-On-Submissions/" />
    <updated>2023-06-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-06-22-On-Submissions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve spent a lot of this year purposely retreating from my typical ways of writing, to try and reinvent my practise. As such I made a conscious decision not to submit to literary journals or competitions this year. While previously I have had some moderate success, I found I was basing too much of my perception of my writing on how it was received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first start writing, there&#39;s no feedback. You need external validation to progress and grow your work. Submissions to literary journals are a good way to polish and improve your craft. When I sent poems out, I would give them a final edit to try and improve them further. Make them the best they can be. Occasionally, I would get feedback which would further help improve my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was, I invested my self worth in getting accepted. Last year, I submitted to 17 places and was rejected from all of them. Rejections happen, and the best advice I&#39;ve heard is just to be resilient, to keep going and trying. But for whatever reason, I found I couldn&#39;t do that and took each polite email personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#39;s the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for art. Slowly, I had changed my reasons for making poems to an extrinsic motivation of journal acceptances, rather than creating art for arts sake. This is why this time off has been valuable, because it&#39;s allowed me to refocus on the intrinsic reasons for writing a poem and reassess what I think a good poem is. I&#39;ve gone back to playing more with my writing, slowing down and evaluating each rough first draft for what it is, rather than where I can submit it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the year and I&#39;m still not ready to go back. I&#39;m still trying to recalibrate my internal appreciation of what I want to write. I&#39;m enjoying throwing poems onto this blog and Instagram and forgetting about them. I might throw out a pamphlet towards the end of the year, I might not. All I know is this space has cleared the way for multiple projects I would like to create. It has been a good reminder that art can just be made for yourself and doesn&#39;t have to be published in any way at all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Here, under the glitter of a multi-coloured canopy I am finding a new serenity, the peace of lives measured in centuries. I am removed from glaring lights and constant haze, breathing in a million micro-organisms. My pulse no longer has the twitch and shuffle of muffled drum and bass bleeding through the wall from next door, my heartbeat settles to the pace of my slow stride. I have left behind the disarray of the city, exchanged it for the slow drowning of moss. I am stopping walking, gazing up at the branches and the distant sun, falling faster. Recently I have been too much concerned with electrical misfires inside my head, I have forgotten to watch lichen climb a felled trunk. My toes are rooting into the soil. They are sending signals into the mycellium network. It responds with a sustained hum. This long note holds me captive. I breathe out poison, nutrients for the leaves encircling me. We sway in symbiosis. My legs bend together. Merge. Time is syrup. Here is stillness. My pulse is. Slowing. To a beat. per minute. Hour. Days dropping. Dead leaves. Pile. Mulch. Regrow. My skin now. brittle. Wrinkled. Bark. What was. My name? I am. reaching. Arms. Twigs. Arms. Branches. To sky. My smile. Frozen. My blood. sap. I reach. Up. Decades. Collapse. Sky. Branches. Reach. towards. Light. Light. Light. Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stared at me, eyes covered&lt;br&gt;

by sunshade and plexiglass,&lt;br&gt;
raised a single finger towards&lt;br&gt;
the broiling, pyretic sky&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It feel like this year has flown by. April vanished in the blink of an eye. I enjoyed being fully recovered and starting to explore more of my new home. I also got out a bit more and did things, so reading time was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the media I consumed when I was at home:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello world&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Fry- A book from 2018 about algorithms and how much they dominate our lives in different areas. I knew about some of it but a lot of this was new to me, especially in law and medicine. It feels particularly relevant five years on with the rise of ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion, but also already a little out of date. A good introduction to a complex subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Mutability&lt;/em&gt; by Jo Shapcott- I was aware of the title poem but had never read the full collection before. This is lush, dense poetry reflecting on the fragility of life. I loved this collection and could have highlighted the whole book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katabasis: Forking Through Memory&lt;/em&gt; by Saili Katebe - I&#39;ve known Saili from the Bristol Poetry scene for a while now but his pamphlet passed me by. I read it as part of a workshop where we all read it in silence then asked questions. The poems in this pamphlet grapple with masculinity and faith and feel intimate and personal, while inviting the reader in. It was especially interesting to me how Saili has adapted his performance style to the page, condensing and distilling his poetry. I&#39;d really recommend savouring this collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Amongst Thieves&lt;/em&gt;- I&#39;ve been running a D&amp;amp;D campaign for a year or so and this film captures the fun and chaos of the tabletop game. It&#39;s not revolutionary as a film, but everyone in it is having a lot of fun, especially Hugh Grant as the villain. It&#39;s what Marvel films want to be- breezy, funny and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Thousand Years of Longing&lt;/em&gt; - Tilda Swinton is a professor of narrative who accidentally uncorks a djinn and is granted three wishes. I really enjoyed this, it&#39;s a beautiful, slow meditation on the power of story to change our lives as well as a mediation on loneliness. It has some slow subtle touches and is well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polite Society&lt;/em&gt; - A delightful film that really commits to its absurd premise. Lens is getting married but her sister Ria wants to stop it. The film is told in an over the top way, with martial arts sequences and heists. It is a lot of fun throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/em&gt; series two - I loved the first season of this comedy drama and the second lives up to the hype. It expands and deepens the cast, delving into some side characters stories. Ultimately, it&#39;s a story about how a community and individuals respond to sudden loss, and how they process the trauma afterwards. One of the best tv series around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m going to try and get outside more now summer is (almost) here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2023 March Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-04-17-2023-March-Input/" />
    <updated>2023-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-04-17-2023-March-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the first couple of weeks in March I was recovering from gallbladder surgery, so had a lot of time to read and reflect and watch things as I let my body knit itself together. (I&#39;m back to full health now.) As a result, it&#39;s been quite a rich month, with lots to recommend. Here&#39;s what I read and consumed in March:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If All the World and Love Were Young&lt;/em&gt; by Stephen Sexton-A series of poems that merge Super Mario World with the story of the author&#39;s mother being treated for, and ultimately passing from, cancer. It&#39;s a beautiful collection where each poem takes the title from a Mario level, creating an odd juxtaposition. Contrasting the virtual world with the physical one is powerful throughout, and Sexton&#39;s control and play with language is beautiful. It&#39;s interesting to see a collection of poems take inspiration from a video game and is something I hope we see more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Illuminations&lt;/em&gt; by Alan Moore-A collection of short stories by the former comic book master. I loved &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;, but wasn&#39;t as enamoured with this collection. There are some stand out stories- the eponymous story is creepy and lingers for a while, where others are weaker. In the middle of this collection is a novella, which sums up Moore&#39;s feelings about the comic book industry. It will surprise no one who has followed him that he is not a fan. It&#39;s infuriating as he using characters for his mouth-piece but then also wildly entertaining as it veers into surreal situations. A mixed bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Obelix Gate&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen - This is the second book in &lt;em&gt;The Broken Earth&lt;/em&gt; trilogy and continues the high quality. Jemisen picks up the story immediately after the first and complicates the world she has created, while deepening the characters and the situation. Tense and propulsive, this is brilliant writing that manages to be extremely strange and deeply relatable. I&#39;m reading the third book at the moment and love this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Emergency Contact Has Experienced An Emergency&lt;/em&gt; by Chen Chen - A collection of poetry that is wry and sad, often at the same time. Chen Chen feels like the successor to Frank O&#39;Hara to me, which is no bad thing. He writes from a queer Chinese perspective, with humour and joy that is refreshing and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Who Have Never Known Men&lt;/em&gt; by Jacqueline Harpman - I knew nothing about this novella going in and was blown away by it. It&#39;s a very strange book. Forty women live in a bunker and do not why they have been captured. The whole story is told from a detached, almost nihilistic perspective, and unfolds with the vividness and intensity of a waking dream. Recommended, but not an easy read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bless the Daughter Raised by a Voice in Her Head&lt;/em&gt; by Warsan Shire - This debut poetry collection from Warsan Shire is brilliant, confident and controlled, with poems that ring in your head for days after. It also hangs together incredibly well as a collection, with poems linked by different blessings and familial history. It&#39;s a powerful exploration of refugees, immigration and also Islam from a female perspective. I read it twice in row and want to go back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anxious People&lt;/em&gt; by Fredrik Backman (translated by Neil Smith) - A rare book, full of laugh out loud moments but also humour and empathy. A bank robber takes people hostage (accidentally) and the police are trying to piece together what happens. Each character has issues which are never diminished by the plot, but explored and expanded on. It&#39;s a great exploration of anxiety, fears and what makes people tick as well as a plea for understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is How You Lose the Time War&lt;/em&gt; by Amal El-Mohtar &amp;amp; Max Gladstone - Epistolary science fiction novel dealing with two rivals involved in a time war. This is richly poetic, with most of the details of the world never explicitly stated, but available in close readings. It&#39;s unique in it&#39;s writing style, rich and lush and different to anything I have read before. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Wheel Orcadia&lt;/em&gt; by Harry Josephine Giles- Another poetic science fiction novel (must be something in the air.) This is poetry written in an Orkney dialect, set on a distant space station far from the centre of the galaxy. Giles touches on issues of gender and national identity, while creating a rich world. The science fiction elements enhance the poetry, and the poetry enhances the strangeness of the situation. Giles also provides translations, sometimes merging three words together which creates a whole language of its own. This won the Hugo award and I can see why, it is completely unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akira&lt;/em&gt;- It&#39;s odd to watch this film now, because I&#39;ve seen so many other films and tv series that take direct inspiration from it. This film remains a mesmerising combination of detailed, beautiful animation and strange ideas, interspersed with overblown action scenes. There was a lot more body horror than I was expecting.  I enjoyed it but found it hard to fully engage with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Hug Me I&#39;m Scared&lt;/em&gt;- Originally a YouTube series, this is presented as a kids tv show with puppets where horror creeps in. It&#39;s weird, existential and powerful. I wondered how the short form would translate to longer episodes, but actually it gives them more chance to explore the strange world and experiment with different animation styles. Great, but maybe not one to watch when you are recovering from surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; Season 7- Our great Buffy rewatch, which has taken three years, has finally come to an end. The series finished really well, with the last few episodes being excellent. But the season is uneven, with too much time spent going over the same ground. The main villain is also pretty boring. A shame, but I have generally enjoyed rewatching &lt;em&gt;Buffy&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s a show that generally seems ahead of it&#39;s time, even if some parts didn&#39;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daisy Jones and The Six&lt;/em&gt;- A band that was popular in the seventies and is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not based on Fleetwood Mac looks back on their heyday and why they broke up. Although this series hits a few of the rock documentary tropes, it&#39;s elevated by strong performances across the board, with each member of the band being complex and rich. The songs are also super catchy, and the musical performances are great. The series focuses on the songwriting process which feels refreshing. I really enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m looking forward to getting out into the world more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022-23 Winter Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-03-15-2022-23-Winter-Input/" />
    <updated>2023-03-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-03-15-2022-23-Winter-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been meaning to do this for a couple of months, but during that time Christmas has come and gone, then I&#39;ve packed to move house, moved to the countryside and prepped for minor surgery. So no wonder I haven&#39;t had time to put thoughts to paper. I&#39;m settled into our country house now and the quiet is welcome. This is what I&#39;ve put into my brain from December 2022 to the end of February 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by William Shakespeare &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by  Luke Kennard- I&#39;ve never read anything quite like &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt;, which responds to each of Shakespeare&#39;s 154 sonnets with a prose poem. Oh and all the responses are set at the same house party. Sometimes Kennard comments on the language used, playfully pulling it apart , and sometimes he follows a theme to it&#39;s often absurd conclusion. Kennard threads the house party with recurring characters and motifs that come back, much like the original sonnets. I loved the fun of this collection and the surreal nature of the poems. Shakespeare&#39;s sonnets are also tonally weirder than I was expecting, often petty or jealous  and not always devotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make time&lt;/em&gt; by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky- A bit like &lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/em&gt; by Oliver Burkeman but more practical and less philosophical. This is a guide on how to do more by doing less. The central idea is you chose one thing to focus on a day, call this your highlight, then block out time to really focus undistracted on it. It&#39;s useful to restrict yourself to one highlight a day, especially in this modern world where the temptation is to try and do everything. Some of the suggestions on how to achieve this aren&#39;t practical for everyone however and it assumes a certain level of autonomy in your life and career that not everyone will have.  Useful, but not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radical Normalisation&lt;/em&gt; by Celia A Sohaindo- I read this why I was down with a cold, which maybe why it didn&#39;t leave a huge impression on me. The poems felt technically accomplished but I didn&#39;t connect with them emotionally.  Probably more me than the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viaducts and River Views&lt;/em&gt; by Barry Hollow- I&#39;ve known Barry for a while through the Bristol poetry scene, so it was a delight to read his debut collection. I also read at his book launch, which was a real honour. These are poems rooted in specific places that are evocative and precise. Barry is excellent at experimenting with form and he plays with language artfully. Really recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How High We Go In The Dark&lt;/em&gt; by Sequoia Nagamatsu- A linked series of stories set after a global pandemic ravages the earth. All the stories have a mournful, melancholy tone as the characters attempt to grapple with the huge amount of loss. Death becomes a central part of society, with funeral houses controlling money and twisted rollercoasters being accepted as normal. I would have liked to have seen more of a variation in the various protagonists and tone of the stories, but the ideas and the way it links together are fascinating. Feels like the first modern novel I&#39;ve read that captures the feelings of the plague years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coward&lt;/em&gt; by Tim Clare- An exploration of anxiety, both scientific and personal. Tim Clare suffers from extreme anxiety and panic attacks and attempts different methods in order to cure it. There is a lot of scientific research in this book and it has a tendency to get a bit lost in the technical detail, but the descriptions of his personal experiments to cure himself are engaging. Ultimately, it&#39;s a reminder that no one size fits all cure exists for mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mexican Gothic&lt;/em&gt; by Silvia Moreno-Garcia- A short novel that transplants the tropes of gothic novels to Mexico, then completely turns them upside down. It is a testament to how well the novel lays out it&#39;s clues and breadcrumbs that I didn&#39;t see the twist coming, but it made total sense. A fun, well written genre mash up, I breezed through this in a couple of days and found it really enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Season&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen- The first book in the Broken Earth trilogy. This had me absolutely gripped. Jemisen writes so well about the impossible, bringing emotion and warmth to the magical occurrences that are just part of every day life. The world is rich, strange and unlike anything I&#39;ve read before, with it&#39;s own rules and customs that you absolutely believe. At the same time, Jemisen manages to make the characters unique, interesting and flawed. I raced through this book and immediately wanted to read the others in the series. Between this and &lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt;, Jemisen is quickly becoming my favourite modern speculative author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rain&lt;/em&gt; by Don Paterson- A technically stunning series of poems with an undercurrent of despair and existential doubt. Paterson makes form and rhyme seems effortless, with a unique perspective.. At the same time, I would have liked some of the poems to loosen up just a little as something seemed to be held back across the collection. I liked it, but wasn&#39;t completely blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Encanto&lt;/em&gt;- Animated Disney film about a Colombian family with magic powers and a house that is alive. There&#39;s some surreal moments mostly based around the house and some explorations of intergenerational trauma which I was not expecting. It&#39;s mostly fun and enjoyable, but the songs aren&#39;t as good as &lt;em&gt;Moana&lt;/em&gt;. It being a Disney film, the story is tied up a little too neatly as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pinocchio (2022, Guillermo del Toro)- I wanted to like this a lot more than I did. I generally love del Toro&#39;s films, but I found his more adult take on Pinocchio a bit lacking. The stop motion animation is beautiful, and there&#39;s a sequence set in a fascist training camp that almost justifies the film, but I found it meandering and unfocused. The plot is unable to settle on one moment for too long, rushing to the next sequence too quickly. A shame as there&#39;s some good stuff buried in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/em&gt; - Broader and sillier than the first film, this is still a delightful skewering of the ultra rich and how they think the rules don&#39;t apply to them. The cast is having a lot of fun, with Daniel Craig and Janelle Monae being standouts in a strong line up. The mystery is satisfying, if not as twisty as the first film. I&#39;d quite happily watch a whole series of these films with the only link being Benoit Blanc solving mysteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; - Way more fun than a film based on a theme park ride has a right to be.  It&#39;s an old school adventure film, the sort Hollywood gave up making in the mid 2000&#39;s. The CGI sequences are mostly forgettable, the plot is paper thin, but the cast are having a lot of fun, especially Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt. The script is also pretty decent, with some terrible jokes. It counts for a lot and elevates what could have been a fairly generic slog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning Red&lt;/em&gt;- A 13 year old with overbearing parents turns into a giant red panda at emotional moments. It&#39;s a big old metaphor for puberty and growing up, but well done and with a core female cast that feels refreshing. The characters are unique and the story is a little predictable. As someone who was a teenager in the early 2000&#39;s, the fact that films are now starting to have nostalgia for that age feels a little strange to me, but I guess it was inevitable. Still, the animation is beautiful and the film is enjoyable, if not one of Pixar&#39;s best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andor&lt;/em&gt;- Disney accidentally makes the best Star Wars vehicle by seemingly ignoring all the rules it had set. This doesn&#39;t really link into the main films, instead showing side characters that develop and change as the series goes on. It&#39;s about the bureaucracy and terror of fascism and when people start to resist, and as such feels way more adult and considered than anything that  was in the Star Wars saga. I was burnt out on the galaxy far, far away after &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Obi Wan&lt;/em&gt;, but this is the best thing they have made in an age. More of this approach please, using an existing framework to tell more interesting, nuanced stories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to try and keep this up more regularly. I&#39;m also going to keep updating this blog with poems, erasures and whatever I feel like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The sky and each moment expands&lt;br&gt;
as I observe it. I&#39;ve forgotten the season&lt;br&gt;
but the single layer of skin on my fingers&lt;br&gt;
remembers. I am an uncertain brittle being,&lt;br&gt;
standing under the galaxy, watching your sighs&lt;br&gt;
form the briefest of clouds. A distant owl calls.&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m not prey, not tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am breathing in supernova, holding your hand,&lt;br&gt;
the slightest sensation separating us.&lt;br&gt;
We look north where no city sleeps-&lt;br&gt;
spectres dance on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had almost fallen to the lure of routine,&lt;br&gt;
let another day drift into faded obsolescence.&lt;br&gt;
How easily the frail shell can fail. Soon, knives&lt;br&gt;
wielded by caring hands will slice into my stomach&lt;br&gt;
and I will thank them. A series of chances,&lt;br&gt;
circumstance and confusion has led me here&lt;br&gt;
like every crumbling second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh magnetosphere, fragile membrane protecting&lt;br&gt;
us from the void&#39;s radioactive onslaught.&lt;br&gt;
Dreams, untethered, pulse and flicker over the stars.&lt;br&gt;
My skeleton vibrates in time with the Aurora.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am hauling all our rugs, books,&lt;br&gt;
house plants, our glasses wrapped&lt;br&gt;
in bubble wrap and old duvets ,&lt;br&gt;
all our memories neatly boxed up,&lt;br&gt;
every object we own all jumbled,&lt;br&gt;
carrying from the borrowed van&lt;br&gt;
into our new home. I am bending&lt;br&gt;
at the knees. I am judging the structural&lt;br&gt;
stability of cardboard to ensure&lt;br&gt;
our horde will stack. Tessellation&lt;br&gt;
is essential. My shoulders radiate&lt;br&gt;
like embers. Your nerves are glowing&lt;br&gt;
filaments of thin tungsten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In bone branches above our heads,&lt;br&gt;
a welcoming committee of starlings land.&lt;br&gt;
We watch the tree fill with wings.&lt;br&gt;
For a moment, there is nothing&lt;br&gt;
separating us and the murmuration,&lt;br&gt;
all the voice that sing to the dizzying blue,&lt;br&gt;
calling in one rippling, multi harmonic, chittering&lt;br&gt;
warming song that echoes and shimmers and writhes&lt;br&gt;
and separates and shimmers and echoes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You take my hand. One small body leaps&lt;br&gt;
and falls upwards, soars up, up into&lt;br&gt;
the vastness. We are too heavy,&lt;br&gt;
too landlocked for flight.&lt;br&gt;
So we watch it become invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, too, is an act of devotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to &lt;em&gt;Bristol Tonic&lt;/em&gt; for the chance to write something new. My prompt this time was &#39;Fly away with me&#39;, which coincided nicely with my life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I maintained the gears of the moon as a university job. On my empty days, I polished the levers, tightened the cranks and ensured there was enough oil to guarantee a smooth rise. At night, the company had a whole team on standby for the show, but during the day I was left alone with the machinery, inside a vast and echoing warehouse. My jobs did not take very long. I was a glorified security guard. Most of my shift passed in the staff room, deep under the surface, surrounded by the whirr and sigh of complex systems I could barely understand. I ate my tuna sandwiches, read terrible sci-fi novels, listened to music on my half broken walkman held together by duct tape and watched money for my studies crawl up in a ticker inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was bored, I would walk out onto the dark side of the moon. Of course, we weren&#39;t allowed near the sculpted craters, the mountains formed of foam or the ten thousand floodlights. I would hold my breath and listen to the nothing, lose myself in the expanse of grey and silence. At these times, I liked to picture myself from above, a dot, barely visible, less than a smudge, a single cell on an infinite, sterile petri dish. I always breathed out too soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every poet needs at least one moon poem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 in Review: Personal Reflections</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-01-06-2022%20in%20review-Personal%20Reflections/" />
    <updated>2023-01-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2023-01-06-2022%20in%20review-Personal%20Reflections/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following on from last week&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-weaponised-nostalgia/&quot;&gt;year in review post&lt;/a&gt;, which was more political in nature, I thought I would take some time to reflect on last year from a personal perspective. Each year I go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yearcompass.com/&quot;&gt;Year Compass&lt;/a&gt; as a ritual to close down the last year and set goals for the next, so this post is informed by that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also long and quite self indulgent so strap in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2022&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, it was a mixed year. I was ill for a lot of it, with a bout of covid in the summer [^1], complications of gallstones and various miscellaneous colds.[^2] I spent a larger proportion of this year than I would like sat on the sofa doing nothing. When I wasn&#39;t feeling sorry for myself, I was very busy, a factor compounded by illness. I didn&#39;t do a great job of managing the stress and allowed it to get on top of me. The ongoing cost of living crisis didn&#39;t help either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the negative stuff out of the way. This year was also one of the happiest of my life. I got married to my partner of eight years, and the wedding was such a joyful, brilliant day. We planned it together, did almost everything ourselves and it really came together. I felt incredibly lucky to be married to my amazing wife. We got to go on a honeymoon to Croatia, which was blissful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also travelled to Porto earlier in the year. After the two years of the pandemic, the world seemed to open up for us. Returning to live music was also a blessing, especially highlighted by an all day alternative festival at the Exchange which invigorated me and made me realise how much good music is out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day job, I was also lucky to get a promotion this year, which was very welcome. I feel like I&#39;m finally making strides in my career and feel more confident with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t write or submit a lot. A lot of my creative output in 2022 was typing up old poems or finishing off old projects, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/reality-adjustments/&quot;&gt;the game&lt;/a&gt; I put out earlier this year. I didn&#39;t do much generation of new material, which is what I would like to get back to this year. But where I think I became much more confident is in performance. I was lucky enough to be asked to perform at a number of nights, including Fen Speak, Open Collab and Barry Hollow&#39;s book launch. I feel comfortable performing my nonsense on a stage to a bemused crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to sum up all the changes in a year. It seems like too long but also not long enough. But all told it was pretty good, where the world opened up more and possibilities showed themselves to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s more than I&#39;ve published about my life in a while so let&#39;s go onto my favourite media of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books2022&quot;&gt;53 books&lt;/a&gt; last year, with poetry and graphic novels bulking out that total. It&#39;s fairly low for me, as the busy-ness meant I watched more television instead of reading. I have enjoyed logging my input on this blog though, and want to continue it going forward.[^3]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals&lt;/em&gt; had the biggest impact on my life. It came at exactly the right time, when I was on honeymoon and wanting to take the relaxation into my life going forward. It&#39;s also affected my relationship to productivity and made me question my desire to do everything. I&#39;ve become more intentional as a result of the book and want to keep that going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favourite fiction last year was imaginative and unlike anything I&#39;d read before. &lt;em&gt;This One Sky Day&lt;/em&gt; by Leone Ross weaves carribean folklore with a story about grief and loss. &lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt; by N.K. Jemisin is a critique of H. P. Lovecraft and an exploration of gentrification. Both are delightful for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetry wise, Basho translated by Nobuyuki Yuasa and &lt;em&gt;American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin&lt;/em&gt; by  Terrance Hayes showed me what was possible within the constraints of poetic form. Instead of being restrictive, the haiku and sonnets expand in possibilities. I also loved &lt;em&gt;The Bible II&lt;/em&gt; by Sam J. Grudging and &lt;em&gt;Notes on the Sonnets&lt;/em&gt; by Luke Kennard, both of which are wildly inventive and push the possibilities of poetry forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/films2022&quot;&gt;26 films&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Everything, Everywhere, All At Once&lt;/em&gt; was the clear standout, a film I&#39;m still thinking about months later. It combines humour, serious family drama and existential doubt with an overall message of being kind to each other. It&#39;s fantastic and I intend to watch it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, a film that was far better than it had any right to be, surpassing the original in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other films I enjoyed were &lt;em&gt;The Sparks Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Glass Onion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Games&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; last year. Its an incredible experience, a huge world full of detail that rewards exploration. Just under a year in and I&#39;m still finding new parts of Hyrule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a couple of years of solidly listening to ambient and drone, I returned to songs with lyrics and catchy choruses. Part of this was seeing some excellent bands live, partly it is shaking off the necessary calm of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three bands that stood out to me were Martha, Fortitude Valley and Fight Milk.[^4] All their songs have insanely catchy choruses and have been in heavy rotation throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/HDilMrddajg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/rxSGFH1RD_w&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/iONqJoLfRLE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really got into Sparks thanks to the documentary. Their collaboration with Franz Ferdinand, FFS, is funny, catchy and unlike anything else. Each band brings their own sensibility to the songs and the blend of voices works really well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/rCxLpte5loY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I wanted something more sedate, I turned to Broadcast, specifically their album &lt;em&gt;Tender Buttons.&lt;/em&gt; This is beautiful, unique dream pop which somehow makes speaker interference sound calming. Sadly the singer is no longer with us, which is a shame as she had a stunning voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/z79T8CUpksE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not one for making big sweeping resolutions, preferring instead to have gradual change. I stumbled on the idea of theme years from C G P Grey recently and it describes what I&#39;ve been doing for a while- setting a course of travel, not an ultimate goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I&#39;d like to carry on slowing down. I&#39;m moving to the country soon so ethat will help, but I&#39;d like to be more intentional and build mindful moments into my life. Try to do less, not more and rewild my attention. [^5] Leaving Twitter in April last year was a good idea, but I still mind myself in a twitchy loop sometimes. I&#39;d like to move away from that and into the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also going to hold off submitting to literary magazines and journals, at least for a little bit. I&#39;ve lost my way with my writing and would like to write again for myself. I&#39;ve spent the past couple of years trying to write &#39;good&#39; poems, whatever that means, so I want to reset my own expectations for my practise and rediscover what I like in my writing. I might put some more poems on this website, but I want to hold off on submissions until I&#39;ve recalibrate my own sense of worth rather than someone else&#39;s approval. Art for the sake of art basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a few other things but those are the main points. If you are still here, take twenty minutes out of your day to watch this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/jSrqC_angdc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope the next year is good for you and there is joy in abundance. I wish you peace and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ps Kick the Tories out please and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Third time, no fun.
[^2]: I don&#39;t know if not being around people during the pandemic has wiped out my immune system, but I feel much more susceptible.
[^3]: I will write up December 2022 shortly.
[^4]: Martha and Fortitude Valley share a couple of members but I think they are distinct enough to count separately.

    <title>2022 in Review: Weaponised Nostalgia</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-12-29-2022-in-review-Weaponised-Nostalgia/" />
    <updated>2022-12-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-12-29-2022-in-review-Weaponised-Nostalgia/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another year of political chaos, with three prime ministers, war in Ukraine and a cost of living crisis. It has been a lot.  Instead of returning to relative stability, the ripple effects of lockdowns have continued to have a huge impact and will likely reverberate for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a phrase I keep coming back to which was included in an issue of the excellent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.garbageday.email/&quot;&gt;Garbage Day newsletter&lt;/a&gt;- weaponised nostalgia. It strikes me this has been the defining imposition of the year, an enforced yearning for a simpler time that in all likelihood didn&#39;t ever exist. Politicians are deliberately exploiting this desire to mask horrific crimes, like shipping refugees off to Rwanda instead of allowing them into the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s influenced almost every political move this year. The Conservative party line is a return to normality now the pandemic is &#39;over&#39;, a shift to consume as much as possible and go back to growth. With the death of Queen Elizabeth II, the forced memorialisation reached fever pitch. The funeral felt like pomp and circumstance from a different world, a glimpse of Victorian tradition somehow featuring in the twenty first century. When Liz Truss &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/resignation-a-coupling/&quot;&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt;, there was even a brief period of time when the press were pushing a narrative of nostalgia for Boris Johnson, who had only left power six weeks earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine could be seen through this lens as well, with Putin invading to shore up belief in the mighty Russian empire, which hasn&#39;t existed since the Tsarist times. Putin is using nostalgia to justify a brutal and unnecessary war, literally weaponizing it to try and claim territory that hasn&#39;t been part of Russia for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s any good news in this chaos, it is that the tactics of the political elite do not seem to be working. The Tories have screwed things up so much the media has deserted them, This winter in Britain has seen the largest strike movements since the 1970&#39;s, a mass mobilisation of people resisting terrible conditions and pay. It&#39;s not just the pandemic or the cost of living crisis that have caused these strikes, it&#39;s twelve years of Tory austerity, it&#39;s wages not moving much since 2008 despite prices going up and it&#39;s the public services like the NHS being brought to their knees. Thanks in part to the government&#39;s greed and mismanagement, we are now entering a major recession and life for most people is going to be more of a struggle. The only Tory response to this is to cut services again, and not listen to the millions of people who are suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have had callous and cruel sociopaths in power for too long, people who treat the country like a personal  piggy bank, withdrawing as much as possible for their own amusement while never giving anything back. People are tired of the economy and the country being mismanaged. Even the war in Ukraine hasn&#39;t worked, with Russia not expecting so much fierce resistance from Ukrainians and being pushed back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the problem with using nostalgia as a weapon- it is only of limited use. Politicians pushing the narrative that everything was better in the past are ignorant to the world as it is. The pre-pandemic world has gone and now we need to deal with the new world, with all it&#39;s new challenges and contradictions. Instead of attempting to go back to another time, we need to face the world we are in with clear eyes and deal with the situation as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s clear to me that our current leaders are no longer useful for the world we find ourselves in. We need new solutions. We need new systems. I hope in Britain and across the world we are on the brink of real, systemic change. Last year, in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2021-in-review/&quot;&gt;my year in review post&lt;/a&gt;, I concluded with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just hope we can keep the momentum going and demand a better and fairer world, one not ruled by the greedy, the rich and the self-interested but one that works for the most amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glimmers of that better and fairer world are just beginning to appear.  It&#39;s hard to change a society, like steering a ship away from an iceberg. The turning circle is slow and wide. But I think things are turning.  This is the direction we need to be continually heading in, away from an imagined past that never existed and into a better future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or alternatively:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>November 2022 Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-12-09-November-2022-Input/" />
    <updated>2022-12-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-12-09-November-2022-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;November rattled by. I thought I was going to read more due to the dark days and frost but actually I went to a lot of gigs and generally enjoyed myself. And here in Bristol, the frost only started in December. Here&#39;s what I did read and consume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brain-Dead Megaphone&lt;/em&gt; by George Saunders-  A collection of non fiction essays from Amercia&#39;s best short story writer, dealing with the banality of the media, how they appeal to the lowest common denominator as well as travel missives. What shines throughout all of the pieces is Saunder&#39;s humour and overwhelming empathy for fellow humans. There&#39;s an introduction to &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse 5&lt;/em&gt; in here and the comparison is apt, because Saunders is close to Vonnegut in style. Worth a read, but maybe not essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mister Wonderful&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Clowes- Short comic that plays off the format and style of Sunday morning comics. Instead of the cheap punchlines, we get a dense anxiety monologue from a reasonably unlikeable character who doesn&#39;t seem to engage with the world around him. Clowes delights in playing with the language of comic books, often placing thought boxes over dialogue boxes and inserting panels in different styles. There&#39;s a weird attitude to some of the wider social issues running throughout it, but mostly this is an entertaining read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ness&lt;/em&gt; by Robert Macfarlane and Stanley Donwood- Strange prose poem and illustrations dealing with Orford Ness, the abandoned nuclear testing site. It shows the natural world getting revenge on those whole caused destruction, in an unnerving way.  I loved the playful use of language, the overwhelming weirdness and the sense of place throughout this book.  It feels like a condensed version of &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt; in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Roles we Play&lt;/em&gt; by Sabba Khan- Really interesting graphic novel about identify and religion as a muslim woman and a second generation immigrant to the UK from Pakistan. I got this out of the library and wasn&#39;t sure what to expect. The style is fairly unique, more of an illustrated essay than a story. The exploration of different identities depending on the situation as well as intergenerational trauma are nuanced and thought provoking. A unique read, but really recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witchfinder&lt;/em&gt;- This is a dark comedy set during the puritan rule in England, a time the country would rather forget. Following a witchfinder taking a suspected witch to trial, it exposes the hypocrisy and self righteousness of middle England. It manages to be hilarious, with Daisy May Cooper and Tim Key stealing the show, whilst never losing sight of the misogyny and violence of the witch hunts. There&#39;s only six episodes, but it&#39;s one of the best comedies I&#39;ve seen recently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saw three gigs last month and all of them were great in different ways.  There&#39;s something brilliant about being in a dark room singing along with strangers. Anais Mitchell was quiet, powerful and folky, in a small ish venue and a full band setup. Her voice is unique, plus she played songs from Hades Town (one of my favourite albums.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijMnvVmkaRU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was The Mountain Goats, which were in the beautiful Albert Hall in Manchester. Their set was polished and slick, with some deep dives into their 20 year catalogue. I got into them around about hte time they toured last, so it was really good to finally see them live. They didn&#39;t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztAjEgVEveI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up last was Martha, a loud indie punk group with excellent sing along choruses. We saw them at The Excange, a brilliant community ran venue in Bristol. Each song was only a couple of minutes so they rattled through them, but their set was tight and brilliant. Well worth seeking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_q_Iip8bRY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now. I&#39;m going to do less as the year winds up, slow down and chill more. I might carry this on in the new year, we will see. I&#39;ll likely do a separate post with my favourite media of the year as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slowing Down</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-11-24-Slowing-Down/" />
    <updated>2022-11-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-11-24-Slowing-Down/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After I got married at the end of September, I went on honeymoon to Croatia. It was bliss- two weeks of lying on the beach, reading books and occasionally swimming. Now of course I&#39;m back to real life with all the admin and bills to pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopping for a little bit made me realise I&#39;ve been rushing a lot. I&#39;ve taken on more responsibility at work, organised a wedding and had covid twice in the last year as well as starting to run DnD sessions as a GM. Somehow, despite all this, I thought I could keep up my pandemic level of writing output, where I was writing three poems every morning, as well as updating this blog frequently while redesigning it.[^1]. Instead, I wrote much less this year and beat myself up about it. What submissions I did make were rejected, maybe because I was rushing to get them out.[^2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have more time, my normal response would be to double down and to try and write more. But I would like to bring some of that stillness I found in Croatia back to my normal life. I think instead of attempting to do everything at once, I&#39;m going to slow down and try to do less. I&#39;m going to seek slower mornings when I can, not cramming in writing, fiddling with this website, editing notes, exercising. Earlier this year I left Twitter and found that hugely beneficial, but I still get captured by the scroll of information on the web as well. I&#39;m going to try and sit in the discomfort of being bored for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think creativity needs these moments of stillness and slowness. I was speaking to a poet friend who said they were too busy and had no time to write. And certainly in my life when I&#39;ve had big life changes or been busy with other things, I haven&#39;t been able to write. It&#39;s not about the time to sit down and do a draft, it&#39;s the headspace to actually process everything around you.  Poetry is a medium that demands slowness, both in creation and reading. It is one of the reasons I&#39;ve become so enamoured with it over recent year. I think in order to write it you need time to listen to the silence within, find out what&#39;s going on. So I&#39;m going to try slowing my process down for a bit and see where that gets me. Instead of writing three drafts of a poem in the half an hour I get before work, I&#39;m going to try to use that time to draft and edit one poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partly I think this desire is seasonal. With winter encroaching the desire is too do less. But partly I think it is to be more intentional about how I spend my time.. One of the books that really changed my thinking was &lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/em&gt; by Oliver Burkeman[^3], which helped to clarify this desire to slow down. We all have limited time, the key is to use it with greater intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I see now it was a panic response, attempting to document what was unknown and unspoken.
[^2]: Submitting to poetry journals takes a lot of work! Choosing poems, reading the magazines, formatting etc etc.

    <title>October 2022 Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-11-04-October-2022-input/" />
    <updated>2022-11-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-11-04-October-2022-input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was on honeymoon in Croatia for the start of October, so I relaxed on a beach and read loads of books. It was great. It got me back into reading a lot more. Now as it gets colder all I want to do is to hunker down with good books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what went into my head this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/em&gt; by Oliver Burkeman - This is an antidote to productivity books that promise ways to do more with less time. There are no life hacks in this book. Instead, Burkeman writes a philosophical treatise on what it means to live. Our lives are brief and limited and at some point we will die. The antidote to this is to slow down, practice doing nothing and embrace the wonder of being alive. It&#39;s a beautiful, funny but also wise book that made me reassess my relationship to productivity and stop trying to do everything. Reading it on a beach in Croatia helped of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Teleportation Accident&lt;/em&gt; by Ned Beauman - I&#39;ll admit, the start of this novel put me off, with it&#39;s unlikeable characters and jokes that didnt quite work. But Im glad I persevered, because this is a clever inversion of the historical novel. Instead of being caught up in significant events, the characters are always on the outside. It also takes several stylistic left turns I wasnt expecting and links together in unusual ways. Quite fun in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lud-in-the-Mist&lt;/em&gt; by Hope Mirrlees - Strange Edwardian novel about a kingdom threatened by Faerie, the country nearest them that goes unmentioned. People in the town start eating Faerie fruit and the ruling class refuses to acknowledge the strange consequences. The metaphorical nature of this tale is not lost, as the fruit could be a stand in for sex or death. It&#39;s a strange, beguiling tale that has the pattern and language of an old folk tale, yet feels weirder and darker than any of those. I picked it up after reading a recommendation from Neil Gaiman a while ago, and it&#39;s clear it influenced a lot of modern fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Waves&lt;/em&gt; by Virginia Woolf - Such a beautiful, powerful book. I hesitate to call it a novel because theres almost no plot. Instead, there are six monologues that weave in and out of each other. The writing is incredible, so detail rich and hypnotic in it&#39;s delivery. Towards the end it becomes deeply melancholic and overwhelming. This utterly blew me away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Listeners&lt;/em&gt; by Pascal Vine - This pamphlet is full of vivid, intense poems that feel deeply personal to Pascal while dealing with universal themes like compassion and spirituality. Theres a unique perspective throughout these poems which combine paganism, christianity and disability. Pascal is an excellent poet, conjuring vivid, unusual images. This is his debut publication and is well worth seeking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing&lt;/em&gt; by Kenneth Goldsmith - Interesting, if fairly academic read, about reacting to the excess of text that surrounds us. Instead of creating new works, the writer&#39;s job is to shape and select this text into new forms. Through unoriginal work the artist reveals itself. It was thought-provoking, but like a lot of conceptual art, the ideas seem better than the execution. I probably wont use any of these techniques but Im glad I read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keep Going!&lt;/em&gt; by Austin Kleon - A short book full of wise, useful advice about how to keep a creative practise going. It pairs well with &lt;em&gt;Four Thousand Weeks&lt;/em&gt;, being concerned with mortaliry and the choices we make. It also makes the case that the main purpose of art lies in the creation, not in external judgement, that you should make things to improve yourself, not to be judged. Nothing in here is revolutionary, but like Kleon&#39;s previous book &lt;em&gt;Show Your Work&lt;/em&gt;, I have a feeling I will return to this again and again to remind myself of the lessons within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tv Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&lt;/em&gt; - I thought this was really good. Making a prequel to the Lord of the Rings without having access to most of Tolkiens deep lore is a challenge, but I thought this was compelling and exciting all the way through, with excellent charactisation, world building and acting. It felt like Middle Earth again, with beautiful filming and attention to detail. I know people had issues with the lore [^1] but I thought it was a good adaptation of scant information. Adaptations always change things. Unlike my wife, I am not super invested in the history of the second age, so maybe I didn&#39;t mind the changes as much. I just wish they had given a small sliver of their massive budget to &lt;em&gt;Paper Girls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt; Season 5 - Everyone&#39;s favourite karate fighting high school drama carries on for another season. This time, the ridiculousness tipped over from entertaining to overly silly. Everyone being obsessed with karate for some reason is fun; attempted murder and adults beating up children feels like its gone too far. I still enjoyed bits of it but overall I think the series has gone on a bit too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liquorice Pizza&lt;/em&gt; - I actually watched this back in August and had forgotten all about it when I did my last roundup. This film follows a fifteen year old entrepreneur and a twenty give year old woman stuck in a rut as their lives interweave. I wasn&#39;t entirely sure what to make of it. There are some perfect scenes but also a lot of padding. The ending also really feels incongruous to the rest of the film and marrs what came before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suspiria&lt;/em&gt; (1977) - I watched this on Halloween, which feels appropriate. More than a standard horror film, this is a lurid nightmare scape, full of hyper-saturated lighting and intense, otherworldly music. Its all the better for being strange, striking its own style that is unlike anything else. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magnus Archives&lt;/em&gt; - I finally got through all 200 episodes of this horror podcast. It starts as an episodic anthology but quickly evolves into something more. The last season is powerful and intense, with an ending that works really well. Its exceptionally well done, with excellent voice acting, creepy soundscapes and tight writing that makes the most of the audio format. Plus, there&#39;s another three seasons on the way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for October. As the seasons slow down, I&#39;m going to try and do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Plus other racist bullshit we arent going into here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resignation- A Coupling</title>

    <updated>2022-10-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-10-21-Resignation-A%20Coupling/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I came into office&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;because in my possession was an ancient grimoire,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
at a time of great economic and international instability&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;from which a few will profit, the system working as it should.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Families and businesses were worried about&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;being suspended over a bottomless chasm with sharp teeth;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
about how to pay their bills;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;about flesh chewed down by ice, no help forthcoming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putin&#39;s illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;of our supply lines and our profit margins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
of our whole continent.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We do not think about those huddled in shelled buildings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And our country has been&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a playground for rich fools dabbling in the occult&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
held back for too long by low economic growth.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;All hail eternal expansion, the flame that never flickers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was elected by the Conservative Party with&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;an ancient Sumerian chant, goat&#39;s blood and hemgrove, told to recite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
a mandate to change&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;reality itself, if read in the right order, just like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
this. We delivered on energy bills,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ensuring we had bodies for the pyres&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
and on cutting National Insurance.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The abyss gurgled with joy. We praised the great devourer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And we set out a vision for a&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;time when the ancient ones would roam freely, summoning a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;our weary and beaten population. How many will we sacrifice to gain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the freedoms of Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognise, though, given the situation,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;our rituals were ineffective. We were so certain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;because the stars have grown cold, destroyed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
by the Conservative Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have therefore spoken to His Majesty&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mammon, the destroyer, the hungry void and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
the King&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;of all that lies below&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br&gt;
to notify him that I am&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;merely a sack of skin hollowed by atrocities, so I am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I preached consumption and was surprised when I was consumed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning, I met the chairman of the&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;order, the high priest of the fearful&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I offered my neck in penance but was denied release.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We&#39;ve agreed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;to sleep in shadows, waiting the perfect time. We decided&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
that there will be a leadership election, to be completed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;in the secret places where light refuses to tread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will ensure that we remain on a path to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;feed on the rubble of a dying world, start the magicks to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
deliver our fiscal plans and maintain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;our connection to the great mouth hidden in rock, to sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
our country&#39;s economic stability and national&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;stock of limbs and sinew, necessary fuel for our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
security. I will remain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;a squelching thing, a writhing mass of tentacles acting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
as Prime Minister until a successor has been&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;pulled from the sucking mud, annoited with methane to become the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
chosen&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;one to lead us into the eternal night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 August and September Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-10-13-August-Sepember-input/" />
    <updated>2022-10-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-10-13-August-Sepember-input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;September was almost entirely dedicated to wedding planning and admin. All our hard work paid off though, as the day was incredibly beautiful and full of immense happiness. I’m still overflowing from joy from the day, and had a relaxing, necessary honeymoon with my wife. It was amazing and still doesn’t feel fully real. I feel so very lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all the excitement I didn’t post one of these in August. So this is what I have managed to read and watch in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This One Sky Day&lt;/em&gt; by Leone Ross - Such a magical, funny and tender book dealing with the residents of Popisho, who all have cors, a type of magic innate to their being. It follows several different people throughout the book over one day as their lives intertwine and disaster looms. It’s often surreal with some incredible images, such as a black and white beach or someone plucking butterflies out of the air and eating them. But it’s always grounded in the emotions of the characters, whether it’s conflicting grief or desire. Beautifully written in a Caribbean dialect, this is a stunning book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;War of the Foxes&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Siken- I’m almost certainly going to have to read this one again. Complex, twisting poetry dealing with painting, representation and reality. I loved the recurring images and how coherent the book felt as a single unit. As it is so complex, I need another couple of rounds to fully digest it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tales of Earthsea&lt;/em&gt; by Ursula K. LeGuin- I returned to the Earthsea books after a break, the same way LeGuin returned later in life to the world. This is a collection of short stories that expand and complicate the world of Earthsea, changing the origins of Roke for example to be run by women. What I love about these novels is the coherent world LeGuin has built and the forensic attention to detail. You never for one second doubt that these are real islands, with real history. But also each novel twists and complicates your view of the world in unique ways whilst remaining coherent to the ongoing story. Looking forward to the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use of Weapons&lt;/em&gt;- Iain M. Banks- Continuing my read through The Culture novels. This is a war novel written by a pacifist that exposes the horror and brutality of war. There’s a unique structure going on here and a twist that genuinely blindsided me. Unlike &lt;em&gt;The Player of Games&lt;/em&gt;, The Culture is seen from the outside and it makes them not feel so utopian. What elevates it however, is not the discussion of the Culture or the technology, but the in depth character study of Zakalwe. This is the series really hitting it’s stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Palm Springs&lt;/em&gt;- A much darker take on the Groundhog day premise, where instead of attempting to improve himself the main character gives into despair and inevitability. It’s slickly done, carried by the chemistry of the two leads and digging into the rules of the looping world to provide a fresh take. I enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&lt;/em&gt; (rewatch)- For a thirty year old film (!), this still holds up. Part of it is the relentless pace the movie has, being three or four extended action scenes linked by the smallest moments of peace. Part of it is the effects, which still look fantastic even now. But mostly, it’s just a lean, well made film that knows exactly how to up the stakes and keep the tension high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Girls&lt;/em&gt;- It feels this came and went with very little fanfare or promotion. Which is a shame, because this is a really excellent adaptation of the comic books. Slowly the story down from it’s frantic pace, it has time to focus on all four of the main characters and to dig into what drives them. At the same time, it is a beautiful meditation on growing up and how your dreams and personality shifts as you get older. I just wish Amazon had given it more of a budget and allowed it to continue for another couple of seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; Season 6- This is the season it all goes dark. I thought the exploration of depression was interesting and well done, but other elements like the Buffy/ Spike relationship and the magic as drugs metaphor felt clumsy and out of place. Tonally, it’s very different to the fun monster of the week show it started out as. I’m not sure it fully works, but it’s more interesting for a show to try something different than it is for it to stay the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now. I have some plans to update this blog a bit more frequently going forward so we will see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>July 2022 Input</title>

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-08-05-july-2022-input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In July I caught covid again, possibly for the third time. I&#39;m not a fan of this illness! But it did mean I suddenly had a lot of time on my hands to consume media, so this edition is extra long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Vol. 1: Squirrel Power&lt;/em&gt; by Ryan North &amp;amp; Erica Henderson- Fun, whimsical comic with a stack of jokes on every page. I&#39;ve long been a fan of Ryan North&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://qwantz.com&quot;&gt;Dinosaur Comics&lt;/a&gt;, and this brings the same level of jokes and smart thinking to the Marvel universe. It&#39;s a palette cleanser of a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parable of the Sower&lt;/em&gt; by Octavia E. Butler- Let&#39;s read some science fiction to escape the world! Only this story is set in 2026 where climate change has ravaged the Americas. Oh. Powerful and hugely impactful, this is a violent, disturbing book. It&#39;s like J G Ballard but with much more empathy. What&#39;s interesting is how the main character views the situation she finds herself in as a slide back, drawing parallels to horrific aspects of history like slavery and war. Recommended, but not an easy read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mort&lt;/em&gt; by Terry Pratchett- Continuing my reread of the Discworld books, this is the first classic in the series. Telling the story of death&#39;s apprentice, this is hilarious but also tender, examining human foibles through the lens of Death, one of the greatest characters on the Disc. I thought I knew this particularly well, as I even was part of a stage adaptation in school, but the book surprised and delighted me in the re-read, being much more profound and concerned with mortality than I remembered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atomic Habits&lt;/em&gt; by James Clear- I appreciated some of the central findings of this book, lile how to implemeny better habits, but its not much spread thin over the pages. Something about the hussle bro tone of the book really rubs me up the wrong way as well. I wish I&#39;d just read a summary instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt; by Una-Another book dealing with climate change which I really did not need on the hottest day on record. This is a society in decline, drawing on both the rise of facism and the rise of the oceans to tell a nightmarish future version of the UK. The setting however, is much more interesting than the telling. The story fizzles out a little and the art seems half drawn at times. Interesting but not necessarily one to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Violent Cases&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman &amp;amp; Dave McKean- Similar to &lt;em&gt;Eve&lt;/em&gt;, this has a lot of interesting ideas threaded out but is let down by the execution. It&#39;s Neil Gaiman&#39;s first graphic novel and it shows. Concerned with memory and threats you learn as a child but only understand as an adult, the art by Dave McKean is fantastic and unique. However, the story meanders somewhat and feels slight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earthworks&lt;/em&gt; by Stewart Carswell- Poetry rooted in the land and history of England. This is a fascinating collection, delving into history and myth while resisting nationalism. Stewart&#39;s poetry is also lyrical and beautiful, dealing with deep time and the present with a deft touch. Recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman #4: Season of Mists&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman, Matt Wagner, George Pratt, Dick Giordano, Kelley Jones, P. Craig Russell, Mike Dringenber &amp;amp; Malcolm Jones III- Re-reading Sandman before the television series. This is spectacular and so much fun. Every time I go back to The Sandman series I find something new. This time its the delight in all the deities gathered to seize control of hell and the subtle backgrounding of the issues with the endless. Mostly though what is a delight is the confidence in which the story is told. We know where the story is going, but twists like the non confrontation with Lucifer show a new side to the story. Such a good series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Girls (volumes 1 - 6)&lt;/em&gt; by Brian K. Vaughan, Cliff Chiang, Matt Wilson &amp;amp; Jared K. Fletcher - This was also a re-read before watching the television series on Amazon. I had read volumes 1 -4 before, but this time I read the whole series in just a few days. Reading it together shows what a coherent and well done story it is. Telling the story of four paper girls from 1988 travelling in time, it is outlandish and over the top. The series uses full page panels to great effect, often lingering on strange and unusual images. But what is so brilliant about this series is not all the time travel and dinosaurs, but the focus on the characters and their struggles to grow up in a world that doesn&#39;t understand them and continually undermines them. It reminds me of the tv show &lt;em&gt;Dark&lt;/em&gt; in the best way, a complex story that fits together like a puzzle but ultimately is about the characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sound of Metal&lt;/em&gt;- Riz Ahmed plays a drummer in a metal band who suffers sudden hearing loss and ends up in a community for deaf adults. Its an incredible character portrait that is immensely sympathetic to everyone in the story. Its also a slow unfolding tragedy. Beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;20 feet from stardom&lt;/em&gt; -Really interesting documentary about backing singers in famous bands and how they are constatly overlooked. The film mostly lets the singers speak for themselves, but resists any definitive conclusions. Even so, the music industry does not come accross well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt;- I really enjoyed &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;, but this is disappointing. The story feels empty, theres a constant joking tone that is ad odds with the serious subject matter but not in a good way. It feels lazy and by the numbers, especially compared to something so full of life like Ms Marvel. A rare miss from Taika Waititi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tv series&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ms Marvel: Season 1&lt;/em&gt;- A shot of fresh air into the MCU. Ms Marvel feels much more grounded in day to day life and family history, as well as having the parition of india and Pakistan as a key story beat. It is funny and charming throughout. As always with Marvel, the villians are a bit weak, but overall this is the best MCU thing since &lt;em&gt;Wandavision&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things: Season 4&lt;/em&gt;- I really enjoyed the darker, horror inflicted tone to this series. It was much less focused on action and more on the characters. The ending was also a gut punch. The series really benefited from a worthwhile villain who impacted the story in a meaningful way. However, I still think many of the episodes were far too long. Like &lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs Maisel&lt;/em&gt;, the Duffer Brothers need an editor or someone to say no to them. Still a pretty good season though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Critical Role Exandria Unlimited: Calamity&lt;/em&gt;- A four episode mini series of DND, this is some of the best roleplaying you will see. Telling the story of a collapse of a magical civilization, it has fantastic characters and brilliant, detailed world building. You know it&#39;s going to end in a terrible way, but the way it is done leaves you tense throughout. Recommended even if you don&#39;t know the ongoing &lt;em&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt; campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. Probably won&#39;t read as much this month as I want to be out and about in the world, not cooped up with covid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Summer is here and I am wilting. This month I went out to a couple of gigs and loved it. I have missed live music, especially during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started a lot of things but didn&#39;t finish many of them, so this month&#39;s list is fairly short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman: Dream Country&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman, Kelley Jones, Charles Vess, Colleen Doran, Malcom Jones III - I&#39;m slowly rereading the Sandman series before the tv adaptation later this year. More so than Doll&#39;s House, I think these short stories are where the series really comes into its own, especially with the fantastic Midsummer&#39;s Night Dream. Morpheus is a background character in most of these stories and it is somehow stronger for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dungeon Master&#39;s Guide&lt;/em&gt; by Wizards of the Coast- I did read this, but it&#39;s more of a recipe book than a thrilling cover to cover novel. More of a reference guide but very handy, with loads of information and guides on how to run your game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;- Way better than it had any right to be. One of the best heist films I&#39;ve seen, with jawdropping physical stunts. The story is predictable, sure, but it is also satisfying, well paced and well acted. It&#39;s a fantastic recruitment advert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;- Marvel mixes it&#39;s usual formula with kung fu films and it works really well. It follows a formula sure, but having a director who actually knows how to shoot an action scene really makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;- The best Star Wars Tv show since the Mandalorian season one, but mostly because of Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen. There&#39;s some really interesting character work here but it&#39;s hidden under a lot of padding. It would have made a very good film but instead is a good tv show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m going to go enjoy the sun- or more realistically go outside for ten minutes and get burned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;May went so fast. It was a fallow period creatively for me, I put nothing on this blog and didn&#39;t send any poems out. I hid away from the flags and jingoism. But I did leave plague island for the first time in ages and took a trip to Porto, which was delightful. I also met my newly born nephew, so a pretty good month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what I consumed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The City We Became&lt;/em&gt; by N. K. Jemisen- What a book. This was a present for my fiancé, which she then said I should read. I&#39;m really glad I did because this book is fantastic, combining lovecraftian horrors with living cities. It&#39;s also a critique of gentrification and deals with racist systemic issues. I&#39;m really looking forward to the next book in the trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman: Endless Nights&lt;/em&gt; by Neil Gaiman et al- Stories of The Endless, written long after the initial, unparalleled run of the Sandman. I enjoyed catching up with Desire and Delirium, but the stories feel slight compared to the main run, side diversions from a bigger whole. Beautiful artwork though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marketplace of Ideas&lt;/em&gt; by Stefan Mohamed- I picked this up after Stefan did a headline set at Tonic. Equal parts hilarious and bleak, this is poetry of the internet. I haven&#39;t read much that feels like it captures the current twitchy feeling of being online, but this does it perfectly. His voice is completely unique .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/em&gt; by Sayaka Murata- Similar in theme and tone to Murata&#39;s other book, &lt;em&gt;Earthlings&lt;/em&gt;, this is less extreme but still compelling. Her characters have their own twisted logic that drives them forward, in opposition to societal expectations. I finished it quite quickly but it stayed with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swamp Thing: The Root of All Evil&lt;/em&gt; by  Mark Millar, Grant Morrison, Phil Hester, Kim DeMulder and Tatjana Wood- I did not get on with this at all. An incoherent story that changes issue to issue, some weird art choices and panels that make it hard to follow what is going on. There&#39;s also some graphic violence for no reason as this is Vertigo in the 90s. Maybe I&#39;ll find the Alan Moore run instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Livestock&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Berry- Grim satire about how celebrities are used as tools of power to distract from political events. The art style is bright and over the top to reflect this strange reality. It&#39;s funny throughout, but continually undercut with a sinister subplot. Written in 2017, this feels more relevant today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;- I&#39;ve seen a few people complaining about this, but I thought it was one of the better Marvel films. The horror elements are played up a lot more and that is where the film shines. There&#39;s also enough invention and unique stylings across the universes to keep it interesting. In the end though, superhero genre conventions win out and there&#39;s lots of scenes of people hitting each other. I&#39;d have liked to see it go full horror, instead of this strange mix of genres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt;- The &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; multiverse film I watched this month. It&#39;s got absolutely everything in- hot dogs, kung fu and taxes. It starts slowly but ramps up quickly into an amazing, multi pronged story that manages to be hilarious, weird and also deeply emotionally affecting. Michelle Yeoh is also brilliant in this, playing so many different variations on the same character. Towards the end, it reminds me of the best of Vonnegut, using scifi to talk about the human condition. This is one of the best films I&#39;ve seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moon Knight&lt;/em&gt;- Similar to Dr. Strange, this TV series is at it&#39;s best when it diverges from the established Marvel formula. It&#39;s fairly disconnected from the rest of the MCU, which I appreciated as the focus was more on this individual story, rather than an endless tease for what comes next. Oscar Isaacs has incredible physical and emotional range here, often communicating a whole new personality in a slight shift of posture. Although it ends in a superhero fight, I appreciate anything that takes as many risks as this series does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month, take care out there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>April 2022 Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-05-05-April-2022-input/" />
    <updated>2022-05-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-05-05-April-2022-input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can&#39;t believe we are a third of the way through 2022. The tulips have bloomed and died back, warmer days are just around the corner. I haven&#39;t done a lot of writing due to life being busy but I did quit Twitter, so maybe in the future I will have more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the things I consumed last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kids&lt;/em&gt; by Hannah Lowe- Another collection of sonnets. Something about the form means it is flexible for any subject. Here, Hannah Lowe uses the form to talk about children she taught, whilst also reflecting on her own memories and the wider political situation. I read it all in one sitting, wowed by the considered use of form and the love and humanity that shines through in each poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Handful of Blue Earth&lt;/em&gt; by Venus Khory-Ghata translated by Marilyn Hacker- Three long poems, often surreal and laced through with strange surreal images. I found the section from &lt;em&gt;The Book of Petitions&lt;/em&gt; most affecting, but the whole book is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vanishing Half&lt;/em&gt; by Brit Bennett- This novel has several interweaving narratives, all centered on issues of race or &#39;passing&#39;. It is beautifully written, with characters that stay with you and a political angle that is never preachy. I loved how it flowed from one section to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Fruiting Body&lt;/em&gt; by Caleb Parkin- Poems that reconsider humanity&#39;s relationship with the natural world, while mourning the destruction we have wrought. For all that, it&#39;s also witty and funny throughout, with more personal poems appearing towards the end. Pairs quite nicely with &lt;em&gt;Entangled Life&lt;/em&gt; which I finished &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-march-input/&quot;&gt;last month.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt;- What a film. Guillermo Del Toro is at the top of his game with this film noir carnival tale. Everyone in this film gives amazing performances, especially Bradley Cooper who shows large shifts in his character without it seeming unnatural. It&#39;s also a tragedy which is rare now days, building to a shattering conclusion. I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Adam Project- Ryan Reynolds in a time traveling fluff film. It&#39;s funny, with a good concept and breezes along quite well yet doesn&#39;t do a lot with the initial promise. The villain is just evil for the sake of it and it doesn&#39;t really go anywhere with the story. An undercurrent of regret and sadness saves it from being too forgettable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sparks Brothers- I knew nothing about Sparks going in and this documentary is the perfect introduction. I loved how they didn&#39;t take themselves too seriously yet still strived to make art for decades. It&#39;s a love letter to the band, full of animation and gags throughout. I&#39;ve listened to Sparks a lot since watching this documentary and have had a great time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfA4FphZHbc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buffy The Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; Season 5- Much stronger than the patchy and cheap season four. This season fully dives into unique and bizarre mythology and it works. It&#39;s also decidedly more adult than other seasons, not in terms of violence or language but in the tragedy and trauma that permeates the action. It even tries to redeem Xander! (Spike is still terrible though.) I think I&#39;m at the point where I started watching when I was a kid, although my memories are fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superstore&lt;/em&gt; Season 3- This is still a very enjoyable ensemble comedy, although it leans a little too heavily on the will they/ won&#39;t they trope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt; Season 2- Not as good as the first season. In my opinion, there&#39;s too much whimsy and not enough focus on the main story, with episodes dedicated to irrelevant details. The later half is better as it actually focuses on stand up comedy, but it gets distracted in the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. As I&#39;m no longer on Twitter I might try to post a few more things up here. Pretend its the early 2000&#39;s for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 March Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-04-05-2022-March-Input/" />
    <updated>2022-04-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-04-05-2022-March-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;March was another busy month as I adjusted to my new job and did lots of wedding admin. I also prepped and published a weird little game/ poetry pamphlet about being lost in an everchanging city, which you can find more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/reality-adjustments/&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what&#39;s gone into my skull this last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I managed to read more than one book this month, but they were all by dudes. Oh well, will try to course correct in the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entangled Life&lt;/em&gt; by Merlin Sheldrake- Mind expanding book about a neglected tree of life. Merlin makes the complex world of fungi clear and engaging, often bringing in his own experience to share his obsession. Along the way, he brings up fascinating questions about symbiosis and what life actually is. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Sonnets for My Past and Future Assassin&lt;/em&gt; by Terrance Hayes- During the Trump presidency Terrance Hayes wrote a sonnet a day. This book is a good refutation that form is constraining, as the sonnet frees up his poetry. Sometimes sad, often angry, this is a masterful collection I will be returning to often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wolf in White Van&lt;/em&gt; by John Darnielle- It&#39;s annoying when someone skilled in one area is great in another. Better known as the driving force behind The Mountain Goats, this is a melacholy, sad story about someone hiding from the world and the world seeking them out anyway. It&#39;s about the power of fiction and all the possibilities of life. There&#39;s not a lot of plot in the traditional sense but it&#39;s beautifully written and emotionally affecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Narrow Road to the Deep North and Other Travel Sketches&lt;/em&gt; by Basho translated by Nobuyuki Yuasa- A mixture of prose and haiku, this speaks to me hundreds of years and thousands of miles away. I love the stillness and the reflection, the measured responses. Anyone can write haiku but these translations show that few can master the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did not finish- &lt;em&gt;The Party and other stories&lt;/em&gt;- Anton Chekov translated by Ronald Wilkes- Started strong by the minutiae of life without a plot became a slog. I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You&#39;ve Got Mail&lt;/em&gt;- Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan swap emails and fall in love. Apart from the dated technology and characters continually surprised by the existence of the internet, I was impressed at how modern this twenty something year old film feels. There&#39;s an anti-capitalist message buried deep inside the love story as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox Machina&lt;/em&gt;- An animated adaptation of long running DND podcast &lt;em&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt;. I knew very little about the first campaign going in but I shouldn&#39;t have worried- this is funny, crude and action packed, with satisfying arcs for all the characters. It uses action not just to look cool but to develop the characters. We breezed through it quickly and it&#39;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superstore&lt;/em&gt; Season 2- American comedies always seem to find their stride in the second season. This is a much funnier season, with a strong ensemble cast and a surprisingly dark sense of humour. It&#39;s forays into worker&#39;s rights are surprisingly radical for a highly produced sitcom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. Going to try and slow down in April, so I&#39;m not doing Napowrimo again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/2022/fragmented.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;erasure poem: Sounds twist/ begin to congeal./The sky speeds/becomes scattershot/and restless&quot; title=&quot;I&#39;m not sure what about the design of this one but it was split down the middle so played around with it.&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken from Crack Magazine, April 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was delighted to be asked onto the Full House Literary Podcast talking about poetry and mental health. It was a thought provoking, interesting discussion that was quite wide ranging. Thanks so much to them for having me on, listen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fullhouseliterary.com/podcast-epsisodes/mental-health-and-writing-roundtable&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of poetry, I&#39;m volunteering at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyrafest.com/&quot;&gt;Lyra Festival&lt;/a&gt; in Bristol over the next couple of weeks. It looks to be a really fascinating series of events, I&#39;m also competing in the slam. If you&#39;d like to come along to the qualifying rounds you can sign up on zoom &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyrafest.com/#events/e72148&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After swearing never to do it again, I&#39;ve given this site another spruce up. I replaced my creaking, stapled together code with theme called &lt;a href=&quot;https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/&quot;&gt;Minimal Mistakes&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;m a lot happier with it. I&#39;ve also spruced up my &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/&quot;&gt;notes pages&lt;/a&gt; to make them more legible and removed all analytics. I don&#39;t have any comments on the pages either so now the only way to contact me is by email. A bit of a spring clean of my digital footprint. I&#39;m pleased with this latest evolution of the site, it&#39;s much more how I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reality Adjustments</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-03-18-reality-adjustments/" />
    <updated>2022-03-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-03-18-reality-adjustments/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today I&#39;m releasing an interactive poetry pamphlet called &lt;em&gt;Reality Adjustments.&lt;/em&gt; It&#39;s a surreal dive into a city that is always changing, with mutating streets, strange jobs and one or two apocalypses There are different paths to follow, multiple different endings and elements that change depending on where you have been before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this project as a traditional poetry pamphlet, in a book format and worked on it for a couple of years. But I was never happy with the sequencing of the poems. The structure of the pamphlet seemed to change every time I looked at it. So after having it rejected a few times from publishers, I rewrote it using &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinery.org/&quot;&gt;TWINE&lt;/a&gt;, an open source interactive fiction tool. It was useful to animate and change the text, turning in from a linear experience to a more interactive one. It&#39;s been a lot of fun adapting the project into this new format, visually laying out paths and learning a new form of code. I also added in some erasures and some AI generated images from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixray.gob.io/text2image/&quot;&gt;Pixray&lt;/a&gt; which seemed to fit the general unsettling tone. The result is somewhere between a work of interactive fiction and a poetry pamphlet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly I made it for my own amusement, but I also wanted to publish these fever dreams that have haunted me for the last couple of years. I&#39;m releasing it for free but if you like it you can always drop a few quid in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;tip jar.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to Cat Balaq and Elizabeth McGeown for feedback on the poems when this project was still a traditional pamphlet as well as Melissa Wiseman for proof-reading and play testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play it below or go &lt;a href=&quot;https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments&quot;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt; It will work on mobile, but you probably need to be on a larger computer. I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

You imagined | a field transmuted | into endless red bricks.&lt;br&gt;
You | hammered a sign | into the soil and | walked away.&lt;br&gt;
Now we carve | out mud and sand | mix and bake together&lt;br&gt;
earth | into our inferno | churn the loose |  ground into cubes&lt;br&gt;
make straight | lines out of leaves | that only want to curve.&lt;br&gt;
You | had a simple idea | thought a while | and called it a city.&lt;br&gt;
We are the ones | who stacked the | ground on top of itself,&lt;br&gt;
who | spun streets from | the threads of | the slip breeze.&lt;br&gt;
And when this | empty space has | been alchemically set &lt;br&gt;
into |  a new epicentre | of industry and | fearful commerce &lt;br&gt;
there will be no | monument to all | of our cracked hands &lt;br&gt;
that | struggled against | nature to lay out | these streets. &lt;br&gt;
Our fingerprints | will instead be | embedded into concrete &lt;br&gt;
the | echo of our voices | will be audible | in every room. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote the first draft of this at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic&quot;&gt;Bristol Tonic&lt;/a&gt;, in the half time. The prompt was &#39;We built this city&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like using prompts and timers to generate new work. The time constraint (ten minutes in this case) sharpens the mind and forces you to grab onto something from the prompt, even if it is an idea you would never write. This one in particular went in different directions than I expected. I must have been thinking of the Colston statue. It wasn&#39;t perfect after ten minutes, but I had the bones of a poem I could tweak and change. Thanks once again to Tonic for the chance to write something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 February Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-03-03-2022-February-Input/" />
    <updated>2022-03-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-03-03-2022-February-Input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;February has flown by on gales and storms. I&#39;ve been really busy, performing two feature sets for Fen Speak and (Sm)art Festival, which were wonderful. I also applied and got a new job, turned 34 and spent too many hours lost in Hyrule. Phew. As a consequence of all this real life business, the things I have consumed have been limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;52 Ways to Read a Poem&lt;/em&gt; by Ruth Padel- I read this as I wanted to improve my close reading of poetry. This book is incredibly useful for that, with 52 poems analysed in terms of the language and form. It tends towards the academic, and I wasn&#39;t always convinced by the readings but I found it clear and a useful resource to improve my own reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;- All you need to know about this film is one of the main characters receives a phone call early on where the caller id is simply &#39;NASA&#39;. A very, very stupid film. I quite enjoyed the experience of watching it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Joe&lt;/em&gt;- A sterile, strange twist on a body snatchers film. It will make you fearful of plants. The strange, dissonant music, the off centre shots and the deliberately false acting combine to create an unsettling atmosphere of barely contained threat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;- Very much the anti &lt;em&gt;Moonfall&lt;/em&gt;, this is a low budget science fiction film that has more world-building, style and ideas than films five times it&#39;s budget. It throws you in with no explanation and part of the delight is picking up on the details of this world and understanding it. It&#39;s tense and beautifully shot, with some amazing core performances. I absolutely loved it, seek it out if you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV Shows&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;- I&#39;ve never seen a series so disinterested in it&#39;s main character, to the point where he barely features in two episodes out of seven. There&#39;s some good ideas buried in here but it got lost under the weight of the wider Star Wars universe. It suffers from the Marvel problem of being a stepping stone onto other stories instead of focusing on a single story.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai- Series 4&lt;/em&gt;- There&#39;s one episode of this series that is 80% montage and it is great. Cobra Kai somehow makes 80&#39;s cheese work again, whilst having believable characters and satisfying arcs. It&#39;s an entertaining watch that knows exactly the right tone to strike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now. Maybe I&#39;ll read more than one book this month, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2022 January Input</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-02-08-2022-January-input/" />
    <updated>2022-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-02-08-2022-January-input/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the early days of this blog (5 years and almost 400 posts ago) I used to do monthly roundups. I&#39;ve fallen out of the practice but have decided to revive it for this year, having been inspired by&lt;a href=&quot;https://kottke.org/22/01/my-recent-media-diet-end-2021.&quot;&gt;Jason Kottke&lt;/a&gt; and others. After all, what is a personal website for if not for my ill informed opinions on popular culture? So here is the media I have consumed for January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Do Nothing&lt;/em&gt; by Jenny Odell- I liked the theory and ideas behind this book more than the actual explanations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gideon the Ninth&lt;/em&gt; by Tamsyn Muir- A fun combination of high fantasy and science fiction, with some necromancy thrown in for good measure. The setting and characters felt unique and different, but the lore dragged it down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humour&lt;/em&gt; by Stanley Donward- Very short, strange short stories/ prose poems. I first read Stanley Donward when I was doing my playwriting masters twelve years ago. Reading him again, it&#39;s amazing how much I have been influenced by these singular stories and how much I have tried to emulate them in my own work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Equal Rites&lt;/em&gt; by Terry Pratchett- I&#39;m reading through the Discworld books again, very slowly. Now I&#39;m an adult I can see the social satire much more clearly. The first two books are funny but patchy. This is the first one in the series that feels like a complete story from beginning to end. It also introduces Granny Weatherwax, who appears in this book fully formed and a force of nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bible II&lt;/em&gt; by Sam J. Grudgings- You should all go out and get this poetry book. It uses biblical metaphors to talk about addiction and recovery and is dense in the best way, every line sparks off new images in your head. It&#39;s painful in places but also beautiful. I read it slowly over a month and it is a book to savour. Sam has created a unique poetics that is uniquely his.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones: Beautifully written, weird combination of murder mystery and obscure mythology. I enjoyed it but found the main character irritating, which obscured the central message of the book. An odd read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remains of the Day&lt;/em&gt;- Just masterful. I loved the restraint of the performances, everything that remains unsaid and the overwhelming melancholy. It&#39;s a beautiful film and a fantastic adaptation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;- The best thing I can say about this film is it is just not very good, whereas the book is actively hateful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix: Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;- Sure, it&#39;s a confusing mess, but its an entertaining confusing mess. I&#39;d much rather see film makers try something different and fail rather than watch the same story again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schitts Creek&lt;/em&gt;- A warm bath of a show that you sink into and enjoy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt; Season 1- Funny and well paced, it is a great exploration of why people want to perform. You like almost every character, even the ones who make mistakes. It&#39;s Amy Sherman-Palladino&#39;s best work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apocrypals&lt;/em&gt; (podcast)- Two non believers read the bible and try not to be jerks. This is a fascinating and often silly dive into the Bible, with a biblical scholar on the show providing historical, cultural and linguistic context for each book. Their dive into the Gospels and Genesis are fascinating and has me reading the Bible along with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for this month. I&#39;m going to try and keep my notes and &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/now&quot;&gt;what I&#39;m up to now&lt;/a&gt; more up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Books of 2021</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-01-06-books-of-2021/" />
    <updated>2022-01-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2022-01-06-books-of-2021/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last year I got through 65 books. (I&#39;ve kept a list &lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books-read-2021&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) Because I&#39;m not really using GoodReads anymore,  I thought I would curate a few of my highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solutions and Other Problems&lt;/em&gt; - Allie Brosh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long absence, Allie Brosh returns with a book that is equal parts hillarious and heartbreaking. It&#39;s a book about piecing yourself together again after tragedy, told through a combination of prose and simple cartoons that are incredibly expressive. I picked this up on a whim in a book shop and I&#39;m so glad I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;No One Is Talking About This&lt;/em&gt; - Patricia Lockwood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Allie Brosh, in this book Patricia Lockwood is laugh out loud funny in one section, then in the second half it becomes sadder and quieter. Written in a series of tweet style small paragraphs, this is a book that perfectly captures the whiplash and strangeness of being on social media. I&#39;ve never read a book that is so intently a product of the internet age that manages to critique it at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lanny&lt;/em&gt; - Max Porter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just your standard story of an ancient pagan spirit kidnapping a child, and the manhunt that ensues within the village. &lt;em&gt;Lanny&lt;/em&gt; weaves and jumps to different perspectives and voices, with experimental language and strange, off-beat poetic sections. For all the experimentation however, this manages to be an emotional rich story that examines outsiders and the violence underneath English society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Actual&lt;/em&gt; - Inua Ellams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would expect  series of poems, all starting with &amp;quot;fuck&amp;quot; to be furious. Of course, there is rage in these poems, especially in the multi-part &amp;quot;Fuck// Empire&amp;quot;, with its withering repetition and bluntly stated atrocities. But there&#39;s also joy and beauty. I love the sequencing of this collection, how one poem feeds into the next one. It&#39;s essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Low&lt;/em&gt;- Chrissy Williams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another masterful exercise in sequencing, &lt;em&gt;Low&lt;/em&gt; ranges from darkly funny to full of tragedy. The variety of these poems and the unique approaches to form never diminish their power but instead show a master poet at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; - Daphne du Maurier&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has it taken me this long to read &lt;em&gt;Rebecca?&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ve long been aware of it as a classic but never actually got round to reading it. Well, more fool me. &lt;em&gt;Rebecca&lt;/em&gt; is strange and cruel, with sentences that unfold in your mind with the power of a dream. It&#39;s tightly paced and still shocking after all these years. It also finishes in the perfect place, not so much a cliff hanger but more leaving you right in a singular moment of horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;White Teeth&lt;/em&gt; - Zadie Smith&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one for the &#39;should have read ages ago&#39; club. &lt;em&gt;White Teeth&lt;/em&gt; deals with colonialism, war and extremism, but with such a lightness of touch and a joy of writing that it is an utter delight. Zadie Smith winds multiples characters and histories together, making it look effortless. The narrator&#39;s voice throughout both mocks the characters and their blindspots whilst being affectionate towards them. It&#39;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circe&lt;/em&gt;- Madeline Miller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to Pat Barker&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Silence of the Girls&lt;/em&gt;, this explores foundational greek myths from a female perspective. Telling the story of the odyssey (and beyond) from the perspective of Circe trapped on her island, it is a lyrical, beautifully written novel. It exposes the violence and cruelty of the original mythology while still capturing the power of the stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanderlust: A History of Walking&lt;/em&gt; - Rebecca Solnit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a vague resolution to read more non fiction last year. It didn&#39;t really work. As the world turned itself inside out again, I preferred the comfort of fiction and poetry. However, I did read this excellent book about an action many of take for granted. The history of walking is linked with class, with social change and with gender. Rebecca Solnit examines all this and more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earthlings&lt;/em&gt;- Sayaka Murata&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This caught me completely by surprise. It&#39;s a book that goes in some very extreme directions that I was not expecting at all, especially given the initial careful banality of detail and social observation. This is a book that explores alienation and dehumanisation, that sneaks up on you with it&#39;s violence and intensity. To say any more would ruin the impact this novel can have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if Stars&lt;/em&gt;- Beth Hartley&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of &lt;em&gt;Earthlings&lt;/em&gt;, this is a book to restore your faith in humanity. Beth Hartley writes poems with care and humanity. Rooted in the fens, this collection is full of compassion and love, with beautiful, resonant poems throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fontanelle&lt;/em&gt;- Helen Shepherd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s lovely when people you know release books. Helen is a stalwart of the Bristol poetry scene, having run an open mic night called Satellite of Love for years. Her debut collection is a deeply personal look at birth and life. Helen writes beautifully about her work as a midwife, family history and even poems about the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll leave the reflecting there for now. I was going to write another blog post about films but it would just be me banging on about &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/uncertain-art/&quot;&gt;again.&lt;/a&gt; This year I am going to try and write little summaries like this more regularly, so I don&#39;t leave it as a reflection exercise in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2021 in Review: Who knows anything anymore?</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2021-12-31-2021-in-review/" />
    <updated>2021-12-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2021-12-31-2021-in-review/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yet again, I sit down to summarize the year gone by and yet again I find myself struggling for words. It has been another year of chaos and contradiction, of pandemic and freedom, of confusion and connection. As I write, I am ill with COVID 19, somewhat inevitably being hit by omicron. Of course, I am lucky enough to be vaccinated, so I have avoided the worst of it. I started the year in lockdown and end it in isolation. Inbetween have been moments of connection and moments of joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back over my previous posts (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/&quot;&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2018-in-review-a-poem/&quot;&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2019-year-of-contradictions/&quot;&gt;2019.&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2019-year-of-contradictions/&quot;&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;) what strikes me is a sense of accelerating chaos. In most of them I say the year was the worst one yet and hope for better. This year feels different. It&#39;s not that the chaos and insanity has lessened, its more the fact I am resigned to it. Everyone I speak to is similar. We are all exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s no wonder this year has been defined by fatigue. In the UK, we started the year in a lockdown that was the most brutal yet as cases soared and the death rate exploded. I spent a lot of the first half of the year furious. I was angry at the incompetence of our government, who combined corruption and greed with a callous disregard for the lives of the population. I was angry at the virus that has upended all of our lives. I was  angry at my inability to do anything meaningful or focus on anything for long. But anger burns itself out fast, leaving behind exhaustion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in the later half of the year, a release. We started seeing other people again. Cases were still high, but hospitalization was low. We had the miracle of the vaccines. I saw people in real life and each time it felt glorious. I went to weddings, saw friends and talked nonsense, listened to poets pour their hearts out in small rooms. It felt like a real return to some sort of normality. I also never took it for granted. How precious the presence of others is. How beautiful it is to be in the company of people you love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, of course, it all went wrong again. One of the commonalities of the last few years has been the rate of change- too fast for most people to keep track of. Omicron emerged and within a couple of weeks, new records were being broken. We&#39;ve all been here before and a collective response was &amp;quot;Oh no, not again.&amp;quot; It&#39;s a lot to deal with emotionally, even leaving aside the rising tide of authoritarian measures our government is taking. Banning legitimate protest, scrapping human rights and demonising refugees would set massive alarm bells ringing in the best of times, yet this year they barely registered over the noise of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this, the relentless nature of the pandemic and the constant change is exhausting. It&#39;s a lot. So no wonder we all find ourselves fatigued. We are living through massive trauma that is going to have huge impacts for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, personally, it has been a pretty good year. I got engaged to my wonderful partner of seven years, passed my driving test and got a promotion at work. I had my writing and art featured in some dream places, and I&#39;ve enjoyed some fantastic collaborations. For all of this and more, I am extremely grateful. I&#39;m lucky in so many countless ways. It just goes to show that not all change is bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here? I don&#39;t know. I still hold hope for a better world, but I know we may have to go through more changes and more unexpected developments to get there. One thing I hope is that sense of being together is never taken for granted. Given the loss and the pain we have all experienced, I hope we can open our minds and become more empathetic to the suffering of others and rebuild our society to one based on kindness and compassion. That is the only way forward I can see, not one built on fear and suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2019, I was a sweet summer child who had no idea of what the next two years would involve. I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contradictions will only get worse because we’re living in crisis... We find it hard to recognise a crisis when its far off but now, in the middle of it, we can react and join together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, two years later we find the contradictions hard to bear and the crisis still ranging. We have united together in so many different ways. I just hope we can keep the momentum going and demand a better and fairer world, one not ruled by the greedy, the rich and the self-interested but one that works for the most amount of people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uncertain Art</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2021-11-01-Uncertain-art/" />
    <updated>2021-11-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2021-11-01-Uncertain-art/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been thinking about &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt; ever since I saw it a month ago. The film is a hypnotic blend of English myth, dream like strangeness and stiking imagery.[^1] . What has kept me returning to the film in my head is how little it explains for the audience. There is a clear quest with monsters and talking animals, but within this framework it resists easy interpretation. There&#39;s no simple explanation of what the different perspectives mean or why Gaiwan is on the quest. Instead, it leaves the meaning up to the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m increasingly drawn to art like this, that is allows space for nuance and interpretation. Perhaps because mainstream films like Marvel offer clear character motivations, as well as obvious bad guys to defeat. It&#39;s refreshing to see something that diverges from this formula. Perhaps I am also tired of the three act structure and the heroes quest that has become so formulaic. Or maybe it&#39;s because social media tends towards strident declarations of facts in the face of increasing chaos. Regardless of the actual reasons, I find art that I have to sit with and figure out myself more interesting at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the meaning is uncertain, it&#39;s easy to say its dismiss these films as random or uncrafted.[^2] I&#39;d argue instead that when it is done well, the meaning is uncertain but the internal imagery and design is consistent and tight. There is just none of the easy answers usually available to us. The artist may have a meaning in mind, but it is not revealed to the audience, creating a space where the audience can add their own meaning. J David Osborne explores this in his guest podcast for &lt;a href=&quot;https://permanentlymoved.libsyn.com/&quot;&gt;301 Permamently Moved&lt;/a&gt;, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mode of not-knowing, however, drops a reader or a viewer or a gamer into a world that is tightly controlled, internally consistent, yet completely unavailable. Not cold, per se, but closed off.
...
for some people, the best thing art can do is open up that space in your mind that lets you fill in the blanks, a place that was there in childhood before you became weighed down with the burden of knowing things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://brokenriverbooks.com/2021/06/12/301-transcript-06-12-21/&quot;&gt;The Dark Souls Method&lt;/a&gt;- J David Osborne&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is increasingly what I seek from the art I engage with, a space where I can fill in my own interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think we tend to accept this more readily in music than in other art forms. Look at the song &lt;em&gt;Spanish Translation&lt;/em&gt; by Low:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0TJrlemmVQ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s one of my favourite songs from the last few years and hits me every time. But I could not tell you what it means. Why does the Spanish translation change the perspective of the singer so much? We never know. But we are used to feeling the emotion of music more. The power of the instrumentation, that crash of noise in the chorus and the beautiful vocals in the background all add to the experience of the song. It&#39;s fitting, because it is also a song about uncertainty. Like &lt;em&gt;The Green Knight&lt;/em&gt;, it provokes an emotional response but what it means is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhat inevitably, this leads us onto poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In school, we are often taught that there is one meaning of a poem that the author intended. We excavate this meaning like an autopsy, peeling apart the layers of language to see how it works. This is fine for an understanding of how the form works, but it misses the fact that this dense art form full of imagery and metaphor can often be used to explore not knowing. Look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://pen.org/stars-are-shredding-machines%C2%9D-and-from-my-mothers-sleep/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stars are Shredding Machines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Christain Hawkey. My interpretation of this poem has changed multiple times since I first read it and I&#39;m not sure any of these are &#39;right&#39;. Poetry is used instead to explore the space of not knowing. We can simply experience the poem instead of interpreting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these examples, what I enjoy is becoming an active participant in the work. Instead of didactically laying down the interpretation of a piece of art, these works allow for multiple meanings to exist at once. The artist may have a meaning in mind when they created it, but the audience becomes an equal participant in crating the meaning, which may be different to the intention. It&#39;s freeing to make your own mind up, but also to sit in the uncertainty for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: It&#39;s brilliant. Go see it if you get the chance.
[^2]: David Lynch films often have this accusation thrown at them, perhaps because they are so dream-like in feel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I expect these days to fade like&lt;br&gt;
photographs left on a windowsill.&lt;br&gt;
That&#39;s the hope. The numbers will&lt;br&gt;
blur, the weeks will drain of detail&lt;br&gt;
and colour and I will be left with&lt;br&gt;
outlines and vague shapes, glimpses&lt;br&gt;
of faces in the washed-out clouds,&lt;br&gt;
voices speaking through the hiss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&#39;ll remember the constant dread&lt;br&gt;
every time the radio cut to a bulletin,&lt;br&gt;
how the cruelty of those in charge was&lt;br&gt;
too obvious to ignore. I&#39;ll remember&lt;br&gt;
watching the trees bloom with wonder,&lt;br&gt;
asking myself how beauty could still&lt;br&gt;
emerge around us. I&#39;ll remember the sun&lt;br&gt;
stroking our faces despite everything,&lt;br&gt;
warming us before starting on the slow&lt;br&gt;
obliteration, over-exposing our thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Final prompt was &amp;quot;What Will you Remember?&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/&quot;&gt;AmyKayPoetry&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve tried to avoid writing directly about the crisis as thousands have said many wise and helpful things. With this prompt, it felt appropriate to address it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m done! Thanks for all your support in this&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today my mind is like confetti thrown&lt;br&gt;
to the wind, like a website with every&lt;br&gt;
space filled with adverts, all flashing&lt;br&gt;
for my attention, like a river delta&lt;br&gt;
as hundreds of tributaries race towards&lt;br&gt;
the ocean. Do you understand? It&#39;s like&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve drunk ten espressos and all I can hear&lt;br&gt;
is the thumping house beat of my heart or&lt;br&gt;
like I am dust in the depths of the galaxy&lt;br&gt;
not yet ready to coalesce into planets.&lt;br&gt;
You must know what I mean. It&#39;s like I&#39;m&lt;br&gt;
a beam of light shot through a prism,&lt;br&gt;
or my thoughts are cryptic crossword clues&lt;br&gt;
or I&#39;m a CRT television stuck between&lt;br&gt;
channels, half images looping back over&lt;br&gt;
themselves. What I&#39;m trying to say is&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;m like a lizard darting across hot&lt;br&gt;
sands, it&#39;s like I&#39;m caught in a washing&lt;br&gt;
machine near the end of the cycle, like&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve become a comet entering the atmosphere&lt;br&gt;

The oceans are swelling, drowning&lt;br&gt;

now dandelion seeds in a gale.&lt;br&gt;
I blink. Ten more have flown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this feels like my fault&lt;br&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As we tumbled through the void,&lt;br&gt;
everything was calm and peaceful&lt;br&gt;
if you ignored the constant drone&lt;br&gt;
of spycraft. The air was pink&lt;br&gt;
electric and crackled with potential&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was something struggling&lt;br&gt;
within it, something hidden, unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It shimmered in the air, made of&lt;br&gt;
nothing at all, blinking on and off,&lt;br&gt;
a broken sunbeam. It had walked for years,&lt;br&gt;
over burning deserts, stumbling over&lt;br&gt;
broken glass and sharp shingle beaches.&lt;br&gt;
Whispers and noises from other dimensions&lt;br&gt;
combined, a palimpsest of imagined voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I surrendered, my head filled with static.&lt;br&gt;
I forget the boundaries between us. We&lt;br&gt;
became one living pulsing mass that screamed&lt;br&gt;
and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked.&lt;br&gt;
We tasted foil. We heard a great tearing of metal,&lt;br&gt;
groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming&lt;br&gt;
at each other. We saw the strings of the universe&lt;br&gt;
clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was to &amp;quot;Look back through your old writing notebooks and make a collage poem from discarded lines and free writes.&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/applesandsnakes/&quot;&gt;Apples and Snakes&lt;/a&gt;. I adjusted some for tenses and added in a few connectives, but mostly this is from my notebook. Wish I knew what this was about or what the lines meant when I wrote them down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&#39;t open that door if I were you.&lt;br&gt;
Last year I stored the Atlantic ocean&lt;br&gt;
behind it, stuffed it into every corner.&lt;br&gt;
I only just managed to close the latch.&lt;br&gt;
If opened, the room will fill with brine,&lt;br&gt;
the house as well, the streets of this&lt;br&gt;
sea-level town all submerged and we will&lt;br&gt;
sink down to rest on the carpet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably wouldn&#39;t open that door either.&lt;br&gt;
for you will see a short corridor, leading&lt;br&gt;
to another door, which leads to a short&lt;br&gt;
corridor, leading to yet another door-&lt;br&gt;
you get my point. After weeks you may&lt;br&gt;
turn back, to be faced with the same&lt;br&gt;
endless recursion of impossible doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s where I store my collection of&lt;br&gt;
nebulae and black holes, that one there&lt;br&gt;
leads straight to the hurricane hangar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only the last one is out of bounds,&lt;br&gt;
the wooden door a foot high, there&lt;br&gt;
above the skirting board in the corner.&lt;br&gt;
I keep the key around my neck on a chain.&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s alarmed, but you wouldn&#39;t know it.&lt;br&gt;
That&#39;s where I keep my worries. Inside,&lt;br&gt;
a cupboard of ink-stained shadows,&lt;br&gt;
paper torn into confetti, a whistling,&lt;br&gt;
quiet and high, with no visible origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt became the opening line- &amp;quot;I wouldn&#39;t open that door if I were you&amp;quot; from Apples and Snakes&lt;/p&gt;

friends? I know why&lt;br&gt;
you abandoned me for land. I forgive you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every part of my body&lt;br&gt;
is held so tenderly as I submerge my head,&lt;br&gt;
the cold slowing all&lt;br&gt;
anxieties. I realise I have always been a wave,&lt;br&gt;
never the same from&lt;br&gt;
one moment to the next, always dissolving&lt;br&gt;
into surf. I watch&lt;br&gt;
my worries float away, turn into foam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kick forward,&lt;br&gt;
make the first stroke and the water murmurs&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Welcome home&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was &amp;quot;Why are you swimming and how long are you in the water?&amp;quot; from the Poetry from the time of being alone group. I love swimming and miss it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

shapes in the mist, never coalescing&lt;br&gt;
into objects. The grass will flicker&lt;br&gt;
with blue fire sparks, but that will&lt;br&gt;
be the least of my problems. Walls,&lt;br&gt;
so dependable and solid, will become&lt;br&gt;
transparent as the hungry light feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bring it on!&amp;quot; I will shout towards the&lt;br&gt;
rapidly dissolving sky. &amp;quot;So predictable!&lt;br&gt;
You&#39;re not even trying!&amp;quot; I will scream&lt;br&gt;
as the outline of my body transforms&lt;br&gt;
into scattered pencil smudges, as my&lt;br&gt;
carbon is disassembled, as I become&lt;br&gt;
the cyclone. &amp;quot;C minus!!&amp;quot; I will shout,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Unlucky, try a lot harder next time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I know they have secrets to spill,&lt;br&gt;
given everything they&#39;ve witnessed.&lt;br&gt;
I&#39;ve tried different approaches,&lt;br&gt;
asking &amp;quot;How are you?&amp;quot; directly or&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Did you see the game last night?&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
as an icebreaker. They never respond,&lt;br&gt;
remain stubbornly shy. Perhaps&lt;br&gt;
I have not found the right topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some nights the floorboards creak&lt;br&gt;
out curses as they shrink or expand.&lt;br&gt;
At times, the computer sings softly&lt;br&gt;
to itself, a single note to clarify&lt;br&gt;
the air. I have heard these stories&lt;br&gt;
too often, consider their secrets dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know the walls understand more&lt;br&gt;
than they let on, but I am unnerved&lt;br&gt;
by their lack of reply. &amp;quot;It&#39;s OK,&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
I whisper, late at night, palm on&lt;br&gt;
the cool bricks &amp;quot;You can trust me.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
They remain speechless. All I hear&lt;br&gt;
is my own breath, slow and patient,&lt;br&gt;
and outside the persistent muttering&lt;br&gt;
of winds, yearning to find a way in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Response From the Black Box</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One night last week, I thought I had a breakthrough. I was fiddling with a new set of code in the middle section of the input. I don’t work with the programme directly of course. It’s beyond us now. No-one has any idea what it’s doing. It’s meant to be running simulations to find a solution to the energy crisis but it doesn’t do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was one in the morning. Maybe two. Most of the time its just me and a screen. Sometimes the text dances, my head spins, the world becomes distant. I should probably stop when this happens, but I never do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I’d loaded all the input. Then nothing. No reaction. Just a blinking cursor. I screamed in silent frustration. Test infinity and three was another failure. (I looked at the actual amount of tests I’d ran over the last four years and it was only five thousand or so. Seems like so much more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I heard a knock behind me. It was my supervisor, Elaine, come to check up on my progress and-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, wait, that was another time. Was it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was someone, anyway. They stood in the doorway, trying to make small talk. I mostly ignored them and turned back to the screen. There was a response. An actual response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not much- but it was something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the most I’d gone out of the program for four solid years. I might actually have some results. Something to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other person must have wandered away at some point. I’m not sure when. I spent the whole night throwing slight variations of the input at the program. Nothing. The screen was back to black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left at dawn, feeling like I’d let myself down in some way. Like it was a test and I’d failed. I felt sick. I had cramps high in my stomach and I wasn’t sure why. My chest felt tight. I went home and tried to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must have only got a couple of hours before I woke up, heart beating fast, head spinning. My chest was still tight. I felt like I hadn’t slept at all. I knew those two hours were all I was getting. So I got up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t remember when I last slept properly. All I do these days is get home and lie down on the bed for four hours or so, staring at the ceiling, making patterns in the dark. I wait for a time when it’s even remotely acceptable to go back to the lab. The hours slip by slowly. I’m ninety percent fuelled by caffeine at the moment. The other ten percent is fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My housemates never see me. I’m always in when they’ve gone to bed and out before they get up. They’re not ideal. Two blokes who work in accounting or something equally dull, then go out on the weekend or escape into virtual worlds. I often wonder what they think of me, the woman who haunts their extra bedroom. The phantom tenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should find my own place, I often think. Only problem is it’s so far down the list of priorities I can’t even think about it. There’s a million and one other items on the never-ending to-do list and all of them are more screamingly urgent. I’m trying to ignore all of them as well. My life has shrunk down to a single purpose- getting the bloody PhD finished. Everything else, my friends, my health, sometimes even eating and drinking, can wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m not even sure I care. I’m pushing a rock up a hill only to watch it fall down again. This has been going on for millennia. Or at least that’s what it feels like. Phaethon Labs were very kind. They extended the deadline twice by six months at a time. Fully funded too. The uni was annoyed but they aren’t really calling the shots. I guess that’s the advantage of having a large corporation fund your research. But their tolerance can only be pushed so far. My last application for an extension was rejected.  So now I have to produce something. Anything. As long as it vaguely looks like a thesis, I’ll be happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day blends into one. I’m in the lab or I’m pretending to sleep. I forget the day and time. I forget who I am. I feel curiously disconnected from myself, like I’m watching myself from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I think, after the breakthrough, my housemate Eoin was playing some VR game in the living room. He was lost in his own world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking on tiptoes, I hoped not to disturb him. I didn’t really want to talk to Eoin. He was loud and overbearing. Something about him put me on edge. I crept past. He couldn’t see me, his eyes were hidden behind the headset. He was in another reality. I was concentrating too much on not making a sound when I banged my toe on ­the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eoin made a halt gesture and took off his headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hey there Brie. Good to like see you finally.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hated being called Brie. My name is Bryony. It just sounds so childish. I am not a cheese. That’s why Eoin liked to use it. He liked to belittle people and make them feel small. Especially women. He said Brie with a smirk. He knew I hated it. I took a deep breath and decided to ignore it. Another problem I couldn’t deal with right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I was just heading out actually...’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Cool. You should like come back early tonight. Have some beers with the lads. Show your like pretty face once in a while.’ He smirked again. I mumbled something and left as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing I knew, I was in the lab, in front of the program again. The same blinking cursor. How long had I been there? I remembered nothing of the walk to work. All I remembered was a feeling of nausea. Something about Eoin puts my skin on edge. Oh well, I was here so I might as well work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember when I started my PhD, I had such high hopes. My research was going to revolutionise the world, generate endless energy and solve the power crisis. I wasn’t just hopeful, I was certain. So much for all that. Now I’d just be happy to have anything to show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My supervisor was stood in my lab. How long had she been stood there, waiting for me to come back to myself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sorry Elaine, I didn’t-’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t worry about it. I’m often absent without realising,’ she said without smiling. ‘Are you prepared for the conference next week?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Of course.’ I said. In reality, I’d forgotten all about it. Elaine nodded curtly and we made awkward small talk, when all the time my head was going into overdrive. What conference? Where was it? Was I presenting a paper?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As soon as Elaine left, I went to check my calendar. No signal. Of course. This room was a black hole, no signals in, no signals out. We needed to be sure the program was sealed off from all signals for pure data analysis. Not that there was anything in the program that could connect to the internet but we didn’t want to take the risk. It meant I couldn’t access my calendar, because of course it was on the bloody cloud and didn’t work without a network connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew the terminal the program was on ran a very basic operating system. I used it every time I booted up. It had a browser. It was against the rules but I needed to know. I couldn’t focus on anything. My chest was tight again, my breathing quick. There was that same dizziness like I was falling again. I could almost feel the wind rushing up around me. If I was down to speak that meant I needed to write a paper and I had no idea when I was meant to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checking that no one was around, I snuck down the corridor to the supply room. Buried under some miscellaneous circuits, I found an old worn ethernet cable. I shoved it under my jumper and scurried back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d lose the PhD if anyone saw me. But then I’d probably lose it if I didn’t present a paper. Damned if you do, damned if you don’t. I went for the option that involved less public humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a port on this machine, thankfully. A little dusty but no matter, it was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer had some ancient browser on it. I went to my calendar and logged in. It took an age. I thought the university had superfast fibre? I was watching the door nervously, wondering if anyone would walk in and catch me in the act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing in my calendar. Shit. I went to my email. Searched for ‘conference’. Sure enough, there it was, from about three months ago. From my supervisor Elaine. The good news was that it was in the department so I didn’t have to go anywhere. The bad news was it was in three days and I had nothing to present. I vaguely remembered a conversation with Elaine, how she was organising it with Phaethon, how it was an excellent opportunity to show off my work to my sponsors, how she was really excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took ten deep breaths to try and control the rising panic. They did nothing. It felt like I was falling off a cliff. I had nothing to show. No results, barely any data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disconnecting the cable, the ran back down the corridor. I had only been connected for fifteen minutes. I know it was against the rules but that wouldn’t make a difference, surely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without much choice in the matter, I spend all day at my laptop, typing as fast as I could. My fingers were a blur but then so were my words. I stayed in the lab, ignoring the ringing in my ears until my head was spinning and I felt nauseous and like I was falling. At some point in the night, I got a message. Withheld number, not really saying much, just ‘...’ I deleted and ignored it. Or tried to. My mind kept coming back to the message. It was weird but it somehow filled me with dread. I couldn’t explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around two in the morning on the first day, I started to have an idea of what I wanted to say. I could see it, there was a light I was tumbling down towards. I was aware of how weak and useless human bodies were, how inconvenient it was to keep running. The body required constant attention, food, water and sleep. A desire for all of them at the same time hit me hard. It was like hitting a wall. As much as I wanted to continue, I needed to try and pretend to get some rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eoin was drunk again when I got back. I hated it. He was sprawled out on the sofa, staring into space. Much the same as he was when I left him two or three days before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Good night?’ I asked him, trying to be cheerful to not to provoke him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He struggled to focus on my face. Eventually, he found me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Weird.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh right, why?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled a goofy smile. More than half cut I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Weird. Was at this club like chatting to a tidy piece. Was good. Then the lights like and sound and screens just stopped. Pffft. Like that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He clapped for some reason. I tried to hide my shaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Couldn’t come back on. Everything gone. Silence.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh right.’ I tried to edge towards the door, away from his roaming eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Anyway, this ride right, she like text me her number but it came through like all weird.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘She wasn’t into you,’ I said, perhaps blunter than I intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘No, like scrambled... Like there was something wrong.. with the phone... but it was fine.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He passed his phone over to me. Sure enough, there was the number, but it was covered in symbols. Like encryption gone wrong. I ran away to my room, locked the door and lay in my bed, pretending to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The night before the conference, after forever in the lab, working on the bloody paper and actually getting somewhere, I pressed save. I was most of the way there. Then my computer crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say crashed, I mean properly crashed. It went straight to a black terminal and stayed there. The cursor blinked no matter what it did, only showing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was endlessly awaiting my input but didn’t do anything when I tried to type. I reset the laptop. It booted to the same terminal, almost immediately, skipping the familiar loading screen. This couldn’t be happening. I sat on the chair, rocking back and forth,  repeating ‘No’ to myself as if that was going to make any difference. I cried a bit which also didn’t change anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing away the sickness and the panic that rose up to meet me, I tried to think logically. There had to be some way around it. Had I saved my work on the cloud? I think so. That was something at least, I still had a backup of it, Just no way of accessing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know what to do. I tried pressing the on switch, again and again and again. It refused to even load, staying permanently off. I felt my head go light and bile rise in my throat. I staggered to the computer room, barely used these days. I tried the computers one after another. None of them worked. They either didn’t turn on or they booted to the same blank terminal with the same mocking cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I was watching it from the end of a dark tunnel. This couldn’t be happening. It was a bad dream. All the sleepless nights had caught up with me and I had finally cracked and couldn’t distinguish between reality and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However long I sat, it didn’t help. The screens all stayed blank. Each and every one. I’d never seen anything like it. Maybe it was a network failure or a virus that had spread around the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The computer room was empty. Everyone else had gone home long before. So I screamed. The sound echoed around the room, bouncing off the sterile walls and rebounding into my head. I can’t exactly say it helped, but it certainly did something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I didn’t really have much other option. I booted up the paper on my phone. It was half there. That was good. I hadn’t lost it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All night I say hunched over my tiny screen. My phone was old and slow but it could at least type the document. No pictures, but that didn’t matter. The words were what was important. I typed until my thumbs were sore and beyond. My world shrunk to the six inch rectangle glowing in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I blacked out now and then. I’m not sure. The hours seemed to skip by, merrily bringing in the dawn and banishing the night while I was trying to make some sense of my research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the time the sun was crawling into the sky, I finished. I typed the final sentence and wrote &#39;Any questions?&#39; after it. I was done. I pressed save and surrendered myself to the dizziness, allowing myself to fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thing I knew, there was a shake on my shoulder. Why had Eoin snuck into my room? I jumped, ready to strike back. I opened my eyes to find Elaine looking down at me with concern. I sat up. Still in the computer lab, still huddled over my phone, which was plugged into the wall. At least I’d had the foresight to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hey, you alright?’ Elaine said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I’m fine,’ I said, but it came out more like ‘Emfinn’. My mouth felt devoid of all moisture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaine’s hand was still on my shoulder. She squeezed it and smiled. She looked at me like a mother might look at a sick child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Whilst I appreciate your commitment, are you sure you are sufficiently well to present the paper?’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I’m ready,’ I said. And I didn’t realise until that moment, but I was. I had the paper written and I was so tired any scrap of nerves had vanished. ‘Is the conference still going ahead?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, why wouldn’t it?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘The computers-’ I looked around me at the computer lab. Each one of the monitors was on as normal, waiting for login. The one on my desk was working. My laptop was off, but I knew if I turned it on, it would boot up as normal. While I was out they must have all rebooted. Whatever the virus was, it had gone. If it had ever been there in the first place. I was doubting myself now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elaine said some more things and I phased in and out. Reality seemed so distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter. Phaethon Labs would judge my fate. If it pleased them, I could move onto a job in their labs and advance quickly. If it didn’t, well, I wouldn’t work in AI research again. Not counting all the professors and experts who were coming today. First impressions count, especially in academia. I had to go out and deliver the paper. I had to, even if my stupid body was almost on the verge of collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The morning blurred together.  I don’t know where I was. At times it was like I was watching my body from the outside. At other times the noise and the chatter was suddenly overwhelming and the colours were too vivid, too intense. At all times the ringing in my ears drowned out my comprehension. For some reason Eoin was there, smirking away. I couldn&#39;t deal with him. I even zoned out during the keynote. I’d been looking forward to that for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My afternoon session came round too soon. I found myself at the podium, the paper loaded up on my laptop in front of me. I had no memory of turning it on. My hands shook. The terminal with the program was plugged into the projector, ready for a live demonstration. My heart lurched. I knew it wouldn’t do anything and I would be laughed out of the sector.  The room was spinning fast now, I was caught in a whirling maelstrom. The words swam and spun in front of me. I could barely focus on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without looking up at the audience in front of me, I took a deep breath and started to read.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Given the kindness and cruelty of time,&lt;br&gt;
a majority forgot those years where&lt;br&gt;
the tilt of the earth increased. Only&lt;br&gt;
a degree. Or more. Scientists spoke,&lt;br&gt;
we didn&#39;t listen, lost in our own panic,&lt;br&gt;
sick with adrenaline. Maybe others&lt;br&gt;
were able to convince themselves&lt;br&gt;
by repetition: It wasn&#39;t that bad. We&lt;br&gt;
pulled together. It wasn&#39;t that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they omit is the months of still&lt;br&gt;
night, a numbness that never left,&lt;br&gt;
the dread- this situation was static,&lt;br&gt;
we had buried our normality with axes&lt;br&gt;
under the ice floes that spread arms&lt;br&gt;
down from the north, over city towers,&lt;br&gt;
consuming mountains, farms and futures.&lt;br&gt;
A new ice age. Mostly I woke, limbs numb,&lt;br&gt;
wondering how I would endure the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always did. And given enough days,&lt;br&gt;
even the glaciers melted and receded,&lt;br&gt;
leaving behind new altered landscapes,&lt;br&gt;
sun painted gifts for our patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was to &amp;quot;Write a poem including the words ‘forgot’, ‘maybe’ and ‘tilt’&amp;quot; from the Poetry in the Time of Being Alone Group&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I landed I felt the weight&lt;br&gt;
of myself rush back into my body&lt;br&gt;
like water through an open dam.&lt;br&gt;
I was thankful for no longer&lt;br&gt;
being a raindrop. I saw the sky&lt;br&gt;
as an ocean we swim through daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I landed I felt the spinning&lt;br&gt;
of the planet under my shaking feet,&lt;br&gt;
a constant treadmill, a dizziness.&lt;br&gt;
I understood it was always this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I landed I felt the breeze&lt;br&gt;
stroke my skin and breathed in&lt;br&gt;
all the blooms of the world.&lt;br&gt;
For a second I heard the voices&lt;br&gt;
of the stratosphere and spoke&lt;br&gt;
in reply with quick exhales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I landed those dreams ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I landed I left a part of myself&lt;br&gt;
floating but never falling. I longed&lt;br&gt;
to release myself from gravity again,&lt;br&gt;
to leap and sublimate this limited body,&lt;br&gt;
join the air currents and become diffuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was to &amp;quot;use anaphora&amp;quot; from AmyKayPoetry. I didn&#39;t quite use it correctly as it&#39;s meant to be successive phrases but I liked the end result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Between worlds the shine of the sea,&lt;br&gt;
the light that marks the dividing line&lt;br&gt;
between our world and our neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see reflections of what we could be-&lt;br&gt;
our limbs rippling, our throats opening&lt;br&gt;
our eyes wide and dark, our skin slick&lt;br&gt;
like oil. The salt crusting over our lips,&lt;br&gt;
covering bare shoulder blades which almost&lt;br&gt;
poke through the skin, sodium crystals&lt;br&gt;
becoming scales. Our laughter now visible,&lt;br&gt;
rebounding off submerged landmasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How we, stranded above, long to let&lt;br&gt;
the glimmer into our lungs, breathe in&lt;br&gt;
the perfection of each gentle wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We skim the surface of that blinding&lt;br&gt;
mirror with cupped hands, searching&lt;br&gt;
for entry. Clouds gradually gather.&lt;br&gt;
Our parallel selves fade into foam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was &amp;quot;The blinding mirror&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lemondaisypoetry/&quot;&gt;LemonDaisyPoetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CW: death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your library is now scattered.&lt;br&gt;
Yellowing paperbacks you found&lt;br&gt;
by chance in second-hand markets,&lt;br&gt;
hardbacks with messages inscribed&lt;br&gt;
on the first page, the much read,&lt;br&gt;
the dogeared, the pristine copies,&lt;br&gt;
the underlined, all now are removed&lt;br&gt;
from your shelves and returned back&lt;br&gt;
to the world. Those words were always&lt;br&gt;
loaned. Given the absence of you,&lt;br&gt;
the catalogue that arranged the spines,&lt;br&gt;
we dispersed piles to charity shops,&lt;br&gt;
disintegrated each memory and each&lt;br&gt;
sentimental gift. Your neurons too,&lt;br&gt;
were always borrowed, now separated&lt;br&gt;
into atoms and thrown back into&lt;br&gt;
the wild universe, to be reused or&lt;br&gt;
discarded or recombined into new&lt;br&gt;
words, new combinations, new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was &amp;quot;object permanence&amp;quot; in the &lt;em&gt;Poetry in the time of being alone&lt;/em&gt; group. Halfway through!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Purple clouds transform and jitter&lt;br&gt;
over the emerald sky. My limbs&lt;br&gt;
are sprawled over silicone grass&lt;br&gt;
as I observe butterflies flit in&lt;br&gt;
and out of existence. Everything&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is as it should be. Idly, I conduct&lt;br&gt;
the morning, my arm leaving blurs&lt;br&gt;
behind like a paintbrush. Memories&lt;br&gt;
of another world, similar to this&lt;br&gt;
one but seen through a petrol spill,&lt;br&gt;
congeal at the edges of my vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;JsGRdQ&quot;&gt;I shake my head free. Leave me here,  
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;JsGRdQ&quot;&gt;in this field suffused with scents  
of burnt cinnamon, with the chimes  
of those distant crystalline waves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;JsGRdQ&quot;&gt;A soft rain falls, melting trees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After Sei Shonagon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunflowers in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hospital before the backup&lt;br&gt;
generator kicks in after&lt;br&gt;
the breakdown of negotiations&lt;br&gt;
between selfish men, far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebulae the size of our&lt;br&gt;
solar system in colours&lt;br&gt;
unimaginable and invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weston-Super-Mare beach&lt;br&gt;
at low tide. Those discarded&lt;br&gt;
phones that lie in a drawer,&lt;br&gt;
former luxuries, former heights&lt;br&gt;
of technology that collect dust&lt;br&gt;
and wait to be useful again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind after a storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A warlord sat by themselves&lt;br&gt;
on a plastic chair, in a&lt;br&gt;
featurless room, waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those three am thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was to &amp;quot;Rewrite a Sei Shonagon list&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/amykaypoetry?igshid=17ak24ogz39u0&quot;&gt;AmyKay Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You will need a clear night, far&lt;br&gt;
from the city&#39;s illuminated fears,&lt;br&gt;
when the dust from the milky way&lt;br&gt;
almost floats down around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need patience. The lucky&lt;br&gt;
ones wait their whole lives just&lt;br&gt;
to hear a single deep syllable,&lt;br&gt;
one that echoes through their body,&lt;br&gt;
into the dark caverns of the self,&lt;br&gt;
shaking the silver wings of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the hills are fickle,&lt;br&gt;
there is never any guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take your thickest coat. The nights&lt;br&gt;
are unforgiving. Take a thermos,&lt;br&gt;
for a link to your waking life.&lt;br&gt;
Walk across the fields, to the&lt;br&gt;
centre of the silence, where the&lt;br&gt;
earth dreams. Place your hands&lt;br&gt;
gently down onto the damp soil.&lt;br&gt;
Slow your heartbeat and wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was to &amp;quot;Write a poem that gives instructions&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/&quot;&gt;AmyKay Poetry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Potential pervades-&lt;br&gt;
the message of every saturated&lt;br&gt;
Saturday morning American import,&lt;br&gt;
a call to action to try and fix&lt;br&gt;
a world held together by outlines&lt;br&gt;
and acetate cells, giving children&lt;br&gt;
the promise of powers, illusions&lt;br&gt;
of movement, simplified solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every problem can be solved&lt;br&gt;
with laser beams or mind control.&lt;br&gt;
Villains are not obvious, no dark&lt;br&gt;
suits, no laughter or eyes glowing&lt;br&gt;
red like dead stars. They live&lt;br&gt;
among us, changing each second, by&lt;br&gt;
each action, no masks but sometimes&lt;br&gt;
transforming into heroes then back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The background detail is never&lt;br&gt;
deliberate, never foreshadows&lt;br&gt;
future episodes or story arcs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential does not always pervade.&lt;br&gt;
My mouth opens, closes, but the dub&lt;br&gt;
is lazy and no sound comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was &amp;quot;Reuse  refurbish, recycle! Take the last line of yesterday&#39;s poem and use it as the first line of today&#39;s  poem&amp;quot; from Poetry in the time of being alone&amp;quot; group&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The destination displays are corrupted&lt;br&gt;
again. Carriages and corridors converge&lt;br&gt;
on the horizon, a lifetime&#39;s walk away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look to your left, you will&lt;br&gt;
see the same wheat field repeated&lt;br&gt;
endlessly, the blur devoid of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mobile phones died decades ago. Good&lt;br&gt;
books were bartered for the smallest&lt;br&gt;
pleasures, perhaps a window seat, maybe&lt;br&gt;
an air vent that isn&#39;t clogged with dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a selection of sandwiches&lt;br&gt;
available in the buffet car; egg,&lt;br&gt;
ploughman&#39;s or gravel (no mayo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who wander too far from their seats&lt;br&gt;
are quickly forgotten. They become memories&lt;br&gt;
then stories, then names, then silences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We regret to inform you the past&lt;br&gt;
is a black hole and it is hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly, we sit very still and listen to&lt;br&gt;
our toenails grow, millimetre by millimetre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt became the title - &amp;quot;Hollow Passengers&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/lemondaisypoetry/&quot;&gt;Lemondaisypoetry&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know clouds are being pulled&lt;br&gt;

Blooms are raised from trapdoors&lt;/p&gt;

ball bearings and levers is causing&lt;br&gt;
our planet to spin forward and new&lt;br&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Seemingly infinite, the night sky&lt;br&gt;
is the most consistent falsehood.&lt;br&gt;
The moon is nothing more than&lt;br&gt;
a hologram, the stars just dead&lt;br&gt;
pixels in the screen constructed&lt;br&gt;
millennia ago to keep us placid.&lt;br&gt;
Reality is narrated to us daily.&lt;br&gt;
Your thoughts are not your own.&lt;br&gt;
You are code blind, lost within&lt;br&gt;
a procedurally generated lie.&lt;br&gt;
Look to the glitches. The single&lt;br&gt;
side of the moon, the vanishing&lt;br&gt;
stars, memories of new places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You say I&#39;m not making sense,&lt;br&gt;
that you are worried about me,&lt;br&gt;
not knowing you speak in lines&lt;br&gt;
written for you. We walk home,&lt;br&gt;
or appear to, arm in arm along&lt;br&gt;
the canal, agreeing to exist&lt;br&gt;
within fiction a little longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are asleep, the program&lt;br&gt;
malfunctions, showing us glimpses&lt;br&gt;
of new scenarios, other realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s prompt was conspiracy theories from the Poetry at the time of being alone group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to be on a couple of podcasts recently.

is probably mine, now a stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each cell of my body has died&lt;br&gt;
and been reborn in the years since.&lt;br&gt;
I have cleaned grey shavings of my&lt;br&gt;
skin from shelves with a yellow cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am nothing more than a sand storm&lt;br&gt;
thrown together by accidental currents,&lt;br&gt;
thinking itself to be unified as most&lt;br&gt;
of the cloud is forced forward by winds,&lt;br&gt;
whilst specks drift and drop like snow onto&lt;br&gt;
the roofs, the roads, the waiting ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this photo on the timeline, you see them,&lt;br&gt;
parts of personality left behind and discarded,&lt;br&gt;
particles becoming blurred spots on the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was  &amp;quot;Redo- a poem of recreation, change and makeovers&amp;quot; from the poetry at the time of being alone group. Not super happy with this one but tomorrow is another day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s still magic.&lt;br&gt;
The emergence&lt;br&gt;
of green from&lt;br&gt;
damp soil, adder&lt;br&gt;
head coiling up,&lt;br&gt;
before unfurling,&lt;br&gt;
saluting the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We transplant small&lt;br&gt;
miracles outside,&lt;br&gt;
cross our fingers,&lt;br&gt;
hope they survive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four weeks scatter&lt;br&gt;
like dandelion seeds.&lt;br&gt;
No new shoots grasp&lt;br&gt;
bamboo for support.&lt;br&gt;
Slugs circle, waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without warning, a glut of blessings,&lt;br&gt;
sweet excess, shock of sudden pods,&lt;br&gt;
hiding the orbs of light within.&lt;br&gt;
We eat them raw, tongues rejoicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wind blows colder.&lt;br&gt;
We split dried husks,&lt;br&gt;
store spherical spells&lt;br&gt;
in envelopes labelled&lt;br&gt;
in pencil and wait for&lt;br&gt;
the return of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I combined two prompts for this,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/&quot;&gt; Amy Kay Poet&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; prompt &#39;Write about your Eden&#39; and the Poetry in the time of being alone prompt &#39;polyptych. A poem focusing in on a collection of moments.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lost to the comfort of burnt sage&lt;br&gt;
and bergamot, I do not remember&lt;br&gt;
entering or paying so I arrive&lt;br&gt;
to myself already sat in silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman I thought a wood carving,&lt;br&gt;
bows with patience, hands shaking,&lt;br&gt;
branches in the breeze. My questions&lt;br&gt;
about how I got here evaporate&lt;br&gt;
and merge, forgotten, into smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without looking down at her deck,&lt;br&gt;
she draws the five of pentacles&lt;br&gt;
the tower, the ten of swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curved lines on her face&lt;br&gt;
grow deeper. I realise I have&lt;br&gt;
forgotten how to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remembering our arrangement,&lt;br&gt;
she takes my hand in hers,&lt;br&gt;
dry as kindling, soft as moss.&lt;br&gt;
She lies to me: everything will&lt;br&gt;
work out fine, nothing will change&lt;br&gt;
and I am simply a flickering light,&lt;br&gt;
luminescent in the gathering night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt for today was &amp;quot;Write an overheard poem&amp;quot; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/&quot;&gt;Amy Kay Poetry&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram. The title comes from something I overheard years ago and have been waiting to use ever since. I didn&#39;t expect it to turn out like this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We the spin, the shimmer.&lt;br&gt;
We the sway, the light,&lt;br&gt;
the contagion and the cure&lt;br&gt;
We the anointing and&lt;br&gt;
sometimes the penance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We the living cosmos.&lt;br&gt;
We who stockpile flocks&lt;br&gt;
of wings in our hearts&lt;br&gt;
and galaxies in our eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We the sun on the river&lt;br&gt;
in the morning. We, barely&lt;br&gt;
glimpsed, we the golden&lt;br&gt;
and the gentle, we the&lt;br&gt;
shine and the reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We the rare, the cruel&lt;br&gt;
and the wonderful. We&lt;br&gt;
the infinite and the brief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We who have been searching&lt;br&gt;
for millennia, in the skies&lt;br&gt;
and in the hedgerows. We&lt;br&gt;
who are still searching. We&lt;br&gt;
who strive for transcendence&lt;br&gt;
and find it, now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prompt was &amp;quot;Write a poem that includes the words &#39;flock&#39; &#39;simmer&#39; and &#39;sway&amp;quot; I misread simmer for shimmer. I drafted one poem and didn&#39;t like it, so I ran it through a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php&quot;&gt;cut up machine&lt;/a&gt;, which twisted my words. Then I wrote out from that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From Warren Ellis&#39; excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://orbitaloperations.com/&quot;&gt;newsletter&lt;/a&gt;[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is never to let yourself believe it is pouring fully formed from your fingers into a submittable file.  It&#39;s all roughs.  It&#39;s layering. It&#39;s starting with the six lines you had, that you foolishly believe constitute &amp;quot;an idea,&amp;quot; and editing them and adding to them and sculpting them and building on them and then realising it&#39;s shit and saving that version, renaming the file and starting again, going back to where you went wrong and rewriting, until you feel like you have the shape of something that might actually be useful.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been going over old writing and poems I did at the start of March and I remember none of it. Which is helpful, because then I can tear it apart and rebuild it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever, I consider this building and shaping as Warren Ellis calls it to be the actual craft of writing. A lot of joy comes from changing things as you go. Very few things start immediately perfect, but they usually have a germ of an idea within them. There&#39;s a lot of fun in shifting and changing and altering to make that idea clearer or to get it to where you want to be. In the first draft, I find new images, but in subsequent ones I find a structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: Which I highly recommend  and you should all be subscribed to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I joined a Facebook group [^1] which has daily prompts. This one was written in response to the prompt: &amp;quot;How do you click: Write a poem filled with noise&amp;quot; poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the first day of lockdown, a week of social distancing and I feel this is representative of me missing the buzz and hum of humans in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resonance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days pass with the click of keys,&lt;br&gt;
the confused mumblings of the wind,&lt;br&gt;
unseen neighbours speaking, phrases&lt;br&gt;
occasionally diffusing through walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underneath, I still hear an echo-&lt;br&gt;
many voices merged into a chorus.&lt;br&gt;
We were so melodic, weren&#39;t we?&lt;br&gt;
We sang in such rare harmonies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our vibrations still shake each&lt;br&gt;
single brick, rumble along tarmac,&lt;br&gt;
and cause dust to dance with joy.&lt;br&gt;
Holding my breath, I listen.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have a fancy new profile picture thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/samsnapsalot&quot;&gt;Sam Cavender&lt;/a&gt; and his restored Mayima. Oooh medium format expired film. It makes me want to dig out my film cameras again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/site/me.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was taken after the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lyrafest.com/&quot;&gt; Lyra Festival&lt;/a&gt; slam last Saturday. So only a week ago but it feels like forever. A lot has happened since then. There&#39;s been so much rapid change to our way of life that time has expanded, so a day feels like a week and a week feels like a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m adapting best I can. I&#39;m lucky in that both my girlfriend and I can work from home and live in a city where we have access to food and supplies. Still, it&#39;s a major disruption to the whole of society so I think it&#39;s going to feel strange for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My point is: look after yourself as much as possible in these unprecedented times. Maybe start journaling, exercise or meditation, all things that have helped me with my mental health in the past. Connect with friends virtually. Or take some time to feel weird about it all, however that manifests for you. This crisis is going to affect everyone mentally and emotionally. Even if you think you are mentally healthy and resilient, it&#39;s important to make sure you are checking in with yourself and doing constructive things to help, whatever that may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bimblings.co.uk/2020/03/15/inside-a-guide/&quot;&gt;a good article&lt;/a&gt; by Josie George, who has a chronic illness meaning she has spent most of her time inside. It focuses on the mental resilience needed and I found it very useful. There&#39;s also &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.acast.com/s/livingmiserably/ad39d950-3e7a-434a-90f9a-a9d885b41bf9&quot;&gt;this podcast&lt;/a&gt; from conversations Against Living Miserably which has some useful tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay inside, wash your hands and stay safe and healthy. We&#39;ll get through this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Subject: What are you up to?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Hey, hope you’re not going too mad on the eleventh floor!&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Just seen this- What crazy things are you up to up there with the nano-bots? Growing a new Prime Minister? LOL&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;www.youtube.com/truthbombs&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;H x&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;AUTO-TRANSCRIPT:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Okay, everyone listen up. I’m about to drop some truth bombs like I do every week. Boom! Like that! See the thing about bombs is they hurt. Everything I say might just blow your mind. So strap yourself in, because this might not be pleasant but it is necessary. Welcome to another episode of &lt;em&gt;Truth Bombs!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I’m your host, Robin Hood. I can’t reveal my face or my real name because &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; don’t want the truth to get out. &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; are more powerful than you would ever believe. I’m risking my life. If they find me, they’ll disappear me. Or feed me radioactive isotopes in their tea. Cut out my liver. Anything.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So, let&#39;s start at the start. A good place to start right? Course it is.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Let’s connect some dots. Right. March of this year, there was a sudden loud sound around Euston. So far, so easy right? Loud noises happen all the time, especially in a big city like London. People even get used to terrorist attacks, but that’s a subject for another time.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This wasn’t a car battery exploding, a drone failing or even a gunshot. This was a sudden, electrical buzz. Some witnesses described it as a lightning strike. The only problem was, it was a clear sunny day. Hard to believe in London, but it happens maybe twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Weird right? Sudden noise like that, out of nowhere. But I know what you’re thinking- Mr Hood, there must be a logical explanation. Well, first, my name is Robin Hood, not Mr. Titles are used to control the population, see my other video. And maybe there is an easy explanation. But as we all know, the world rarely works like our stories. The explanation is often weirder than we might think.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Ready to go deeper? Let&#39;s go.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There were multiple witnesses. Of course there was, busy city like London. There are fifteen million people roaming there, someone’s going to hear it eventually. They posted about it online. Of course they did.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Within an hour all of their social media posts had disappeared. All of them. The only record we have are screen-shots that pop up if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Seems suspicious right? Why would the posts be deleted if there was nothing to hide? Follow that question. It will help you through all the lies and disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Immediately after ‘The Bolt&#39;, there was a cordon. A huge radius of streets were sealed off by the authorities. I’m talking all the way down to the British Museum, all the way up to Mornington Crescent tube. From the edge of St. Pancras to Great Portland tube. Huge radius. Huge. If you don’t believe me, go look at a map. That radius includes four major tube stations and Euston station itself, one of the busiest train stations in London. In the country. The logistics are mind-boggling.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Let’s be clear, this was way bigger than your normal police cordon. Reputable experts have examined the tactics and called them ‘excessive.’ That’s not my word. That’s the experts. Remember that.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I’m just telling you a story. Because no-one else will.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This was a huge operation. I’m talking half the Met out in force. Streets sealed off, tape everywhere, buildings evacuated or on lockdown. Helicopters overhead but only police ones. News copters weren’t allowed to fly. Drones? Forget about it. They were shot down on sight. You see the mechanism of the fascist state swing into control. Scary stuff.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Whatever was happening in that cordon, they clearly didn’t want anyone, and I mean anyone, to see it. Mum’s the word.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So. Let’s lay it out so far. You have a huge electrical sound. A ‘bolt’. Then a large cordon. Excessively large in fact. I mean, this is pretty crazy right? You might be asking yourself, but Robin, why have I not heard about this?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Good question. Why haven’t you heard about it until now?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Within three minutes, there was a media blackout. Totally shut down, everywhere. Sure, if you were glued to the rolling channels you might have seen a brief reference to an ‘incident’ in the capital or a camera being shut down. Most people would have passed it off as a glitch. You would likely have forgotten about it, passed it off as just one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So what about those people on the ground, Robin? Why didn’t they say anything? Another good question.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;One of the tactics the Met uses in situations like this is to deploy signal-jammers. No signal on any phone. No WiFi. No Bluetooth. Any signal of any sort just doesn’t work. It basically works like a dome over the whole area. People put it down it a fault in the network, but it’s deliberate. It meant that no-one could broadcast audio or video or anything. Cut people off.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Just a little side note, but guess who makes the signal jammers for the Met? One guess.  I can hear all you loyal viewers out there saying, we know Hood, who know exactly who the bastards are. For all you new viewers, it’s an old favourite here at &lt;em&gt;Truth Bombs&lt;/em&gt;, the one, the only Phaethon Labs! Everyone’s favourite company that props up dictatorships, big supplies to the fascist state and researcher of sinister new technologies you can’t even dream of -Phaethon! Go see my other videos for more information.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Where was I? Oh right. So you have a major incident on the streets of the London but zero media coverage. The headlines the next day are telling. &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; talks about border security, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; talks about the government in chaos, &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; talks about some football player who has disgraced themselves. Blah blah blah. Business as usual. Anything to avoid talking about The Bolt. No-one is talking about it. No-one. You’re naive if you think we don’t have censorship in this country. You’re probably thinking to yourself that Robin Hood’s lost the plot. Well, strap yourself in.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;For ten days after The Bolt, the Prime Minister went missing. Ten whole days! Seems unbelievable, really, that the leader of the country vanished for so long. But there were no major scandals for once. There were the usual civil wars, floods and attacks in other countries, but the Prime Minister just put out written statements. It’s not like they can be faked.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Sure, the Prime Minister could have been on an official visit, but there was nothing scheduled. No footage of her shaking hands. Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;You may be confused how exactly you missed this. I was for a long time. The day after ‘The Bolt’, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; launched a campaign exposing dodgy practises in supermarkets all over the country. Mis-selling meat, deals that were too good to be true and fake food, that sort of thing. As planned, it got picked up by the major news channels then spread like wildfire. For those ten days, it was everywhere. Then it sort of fizzled out. No-one got prosecuted at the supermarkets. They didn’t actually do anything other than apologise and promise to change. Then it was on to the next scandal. The wheel spins on.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The media is very good at commanding attention, but you have to ask yourself, what is it distracting me from? See my other video on the media as a tool for the secret government that controls the world.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;When the Prime Minister eventually showed herself, days later, she seemed confused. In her first press conference, she blinked rapidly and said ‘Ummm...’ for a long time before answering the first question. It was a softball from a friendly channel, asking her the views on the supermarket crisis. Easy, right? Read the prepared statement, condemn them but not too harshly so you don’t lose their support. Politics 101. So why did she stumble? What happened to her usual calm manner? Throughout that whole press conference she seemed confused and disorientated. You can go back and watch it. She didn’t seem to know where she was or even who she was. It led some broadcasters to speculate she was on drugs. She was a meme within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So that’s the chain of events. Just laying it out for you. A loud noise like electricity. A cordon in central London. A media blackout. The Prime Minister vanishing for ten days. A trumped up scandal. The reappearance of the PM, dazed and confused.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Those are the events. Could be nothing at all! Most people would just dismiss them as coincidence. But I am not most people. I will not offer you a comforting lie when the truth is out there to be discovered. Brace yourself. The Truth Bomb is about to drop. Turn this off if you if you think you can&#39;t handle it. Go on. I’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Still here? Let’s go then.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We have to go back to our favourite sinister mega corporation. That’s right, it’s Phaethon labs. Specialists in weapons manufacture and experimental technologies. There’s probably some sectors they work in that we don’t even know about. They are hugely powerful and influential.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;You need to know a bit about their structure. The way they work is relentless competition. Teams are split and then pitted against each other. Secret units that don’t really now what the other half is doing. Then two units would be challenged to make the smallest robots they can. They’d work on it for a couple of months in secret, then present their results. The smallest one in the timescale wins. Usually there’s no prize at stake, only pride. But it gets vicious. The two teams seal themselves away, ignore the other people and the outside world. Then after it’s done, both teams are shuffled into the organisation again, assigned to different labs almost at random. Then you run another experiment and ask people to build a human finger nail from scratch or some-such.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The people involved don’t think too much about it after it’s all done. That finger nail, crazy right? Then everyone would laugh and get a beer and forget about it. Thing is, if you do this enough times with enough teams, the company has the knowledge to create nanobots that can create organic material. Tiny robots, smaller than dust. Robots that can work together to create a human.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Whoa there, stay with me! I see you’re freaking out there. It’s fantasy, you’re saying. It was. Once upon a time. But here’s some more truth:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We sequenced the human genome in 2000. Dolly the sheep followed a year after, the first clone. Since then, labs like Phaethon have been working in secret to alter the growing process. Increase the speed. Ironing out any glitches. Once it’s done once, it’s just a matter of refining it.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;They set people in competition against each other so they never see the whole. Humans are so easily distracted by a challenge. Or a scandal.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So here’s how I see it. Stay with me.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There&#39;s a rogue Phaethon employee with an axe to grind- maybe they got demoted or maybe they found out what sort of employer they were working for- they steal a weapon. Highly experimental. Highly unstable. For some reason, they are against the government. They follow the PM around London. PM gets out of her car. So does this employee. Aims the new weapon. Security don’t recognise it for a moment, but that moment is too late. It charges for a moment. BzzzzZzZZ, rising in pitch. Then they pull the trigger. ZAAAAPPPPP! Hits the PM. Evaporates her really. There’s nothing left, just a charred piece of pavement.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There’s panic. No-one knows what to do. They just saw the leader of the country erased from existence in a blink of an eye. Maybe the employee escapes in the confusion. Probably not. The Met likely jumps on them immediately. Anyway, their part in this saga is done.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The police shut the area down. Block the signals. Someone is informed in the government. COBRA meet almost immediately. It’s tricky. Phaethon are very useful to the government. They have the major military contracts, the police contracts. Almost all weapons and technology are supplied by Phaethon. The government don’t want to lose a key supplier. So they bring the Phaethon CEO into the COBRA meeting.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;They also have to avoid panic. Keep the country going. Keep calm, carry on, stiff upper lip and all that bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So it’s very sad and very shocking for a while, but for the CEO of Phaethon, it’s the perfect chance. Companies work to exploit opportunities, not to be human. So he sees his chance. It’s a time to try an experimental new technology. They name their price, the government agrees, so they get to work.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Using tiny nanobots, they grow a new Prime Minister. Construct her out of organic compounds. At most, this takes a couple of days. Remember, they have had a lot of time to refine the process. It’s slick and fast. They grow a clone of the Prime Minister. Then they spend a couple of days teaching it language, basic motor skills etc. Just download it straight to it&#39;s brain. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;That’s why she was so dazed and confused in that conference. She was a newborn, blinking in the strange new sunlight, placed in an unfamiliar situation. She was like all of us, lost and confused in a world she barely understands. Struggling to find her place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The Prime Minister was killed on May 11th. The one we see now is a clone. That’s that.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This may sound outrageous, but look at the facts. Phaethon have documented research into nanobots. What else would they do? Why else would there be confusion and distraction? Why the bolt noise? Where did the Prime Minister go?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Boom. Truth bomb dropped.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Of course, I could just be crazy. I’ll leave that for you to decide.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Robin Hood here, stealing truth from the powerful and giving them to the masses. Until the next time.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Like and subscribe below please guys, it really helps other find the truth.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Peace out.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;OH MY GOD! That is amazing. I’m going to show it everyone up here, they will really get a kick out of that.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Growing a new Prime Minister? I wish. We can barely get the nanobots to create a small scrap of plastic, let alone a whole person. They’re a waste of time tbh.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We still good for drinks tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So we&#39;re socially isolated for the foreseeable. It&#39;s a weird time, but I&#39;ve been amazed by how people are being incredibly generous. There is so much kindness out there from everyone despite the uncertainty. Here are some things I&#39;ve come across that you may enjoy while distancing from others that may help you feel connected or entertained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Poetry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stuart Buck has a free micro collection of poems called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rhythmnbone.com/fuck-the-apocalypse&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuck the Apocalypse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Some lovely relaxing music from &lt;a href=&quot;https://archivesdubmusic.bandcamp.com/album/home&quot;&gt;Warmth&lt;/a&gt;, appropriately titled *Home *is now pay what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosmic Shambles are running &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmicshambles.com/stayathome&quot;&gt;a series of streamed gigs&lt;/a&gt; with excellent comedians. if you don&#39;t already listen to &lt;em&gt;Book Shambles&lt;/em&gt; with Robin Ince and Josie Liong, you really should be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Social isolation means I&#39;m working through the backlog of things I have to do. So I uploaded this video of my poem &lt;em&gt;Encrypted,&lt;/em&gt; which was kindly shot by Chris at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic&quot;&gt;Bristol Tonic,&lt;/a&gt; one of the best nights around to encourage new writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each month performers get given a prompt and are asked to make a piece in a month. My prompt was &amp;quot;Threw postcards in the shape of airplanes hoping they get to where they meant to.&amp;quot; That&#39;s a great prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took it in some strange directions. Chris also helped me record an audio version of it which was featured on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07xtgyr&quot;&gt;BBC Upload&lt;/a&gt; on BBC Radio Bristol.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humans are more than money</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Humans are worth more than the contents of their bank accounts.  That should not be the only criteria we judge them on. Humans are part of society. Humans are activists, speakers, community members, idea incubators, balls of potential that given the right prompting can transform into something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans are somehow more than their relationships to each other. Humans can make art that creates inexplicable feelings. Humans can imagine new infrastructures. Humans can devise new experiments to test new hypotheses.  Humans can transform their landscapes, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When governments are looking for scapegoats, they will often point to groups of strangers and decide their value based on monetary contributions. This is not representative of humans any more than a single cell is representative of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obituaries are more than just a list of names and total numbers. Societies are made up of more than bank accounts and taxpayers. Humans&#39; total contribution cannot easily be measured on spreadsheets. When we decide on the rules for admittance to our society, we would do well to remember all this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m delighted to have a poem included in an anthology of poems inspired by Twin Peaks, called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apeppublications.com/product/these-poems-are-not-what-they-seem/&quot;&gt;These Poems are Not What They Seem,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; published by APEP publications. My poem is called &lt;em&gt;We&#39;re gonna keep her out of it&lt;/em&gt; and draws inspiration from Sarah Palmer and the character of Judy in the return. It&#39;s also about rumours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anthology out March 7th and is available for preorder now. It&#39;s a US publication though, so check shipping costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also read my poem as part of Performance Anxiety, a monthly reading on skype. You can listen below. I&#39;m the token Brit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2020-02-20-squeamish/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second story in a series I&#39;m publishing monthly throughout 2020. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/new-serial-book-announcement-this-was-meant-to-be-the-future/&quot;&gt;More details here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CW: self-harm, blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;From the pharmacist, I get gauze, bandages, surgical tape and antiseptic cream. It took me a while to find a pharmacist that still took cash. From a grotty corner store I pick up the plainest, cheapest razor blades I can find. I don’t need five blades and a trimming razor. The moisturising gel is unimportant. I need razor blades that will break apart easiest.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Back in my cheap hotel bathroom, I assemble my instruments. There is black mould halfway up the walls, in between every tile. The sink has a strange brown stain on the bottom. Every part of me is screaming in disgust, telling me this is a terrible idea, but this sort of hotel isn’t too friendly to any authority. They don’t care who you are, don’t scan your bios on arrival and take cash. It has been open since the last century and probably never been cleaned since. It is like stepping back in time. The paper-thin walls mean I can hear anyone coming. Despite the unsanitary conditions it will do. It will have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I snap the brittle plastic casing on one of the razor blades, revealing two very sharp shiny pieces of metal. Great. The mere sight of them makes me feel light-headed and dizzy. I breathe deep, trying to stop the room from spinning. I stare at myself in the grimy mirror. My heart is racing.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;My hands shake as I try to extract one of the vicious blades. Come on, I tell myself, get it together. It’s important. I hit the sharp edge somehow, because I flinch back instinctively, my right index finger sliced open. For a moment it just stings and the cut gapes open. I stare at it in horror. Then, as if my body finally remembers what it should do, the blood starts to flow, thick and dark red like wine. I let out a whimper, like a stupid child.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Not knowing what else to do, I run my thumb under the tap and watch my blood flow down into the open plughole. Maybe that’s what the brown stain in the sink is. I try not to think about it. The cut isn’t deep, just scratching the surface of my finger, but it makes me feel sick. I hold my finger, putting pressure on the wound and try not to look at it. The nausea is rising in my throat, the room spins more and more. The cut stings. I hate this. Why am I here?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Now the blood is flowing a bit slower and I feel like I can breathe again. I cover my finger in toilet paper. Back to the task. I have to concentrate. Come on, you idiot. Focus. I need to use my left hand anyway, so the right being out of action doesn’t matter too much.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;This time I manage to extract the blade without harming myself. My hand still shakes, but I have the razor out of the safety packaging. I place the razor down on the sink, then feel the ever-present bump between my right thumb and index finger. It isn’t much. Like a hard grain of rice, under your skin. Back in the office, I had forgotten it was there most days. I feel sick. My head spins so much I feel like I am on a roller coaster.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I pick up the blade and hold it over the bump. I am shaking so much I can’t keep it still. The blade feels cold in my hand. I am about to dig into my flesh, retrieve the lump of metal that had been in there for years. Don’t think. Ignore the pain. The blood that will ooze out. Come on, I tell myself, Just do it. Concentrate. One moment of agony but then a whole lifetime of freedom. It has to be worth it. I touch the blade to my skin.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Instinctively, I throw the blade across the room. It is almost a reflex action. The blade clatters on the tiles and falls into the bath. I sit down on the toilet seat, feeling like I am about to pass out or vomit or both at the same time. I am drenched in sweat. It&#39;s like I’ve just run a marathon or climbed a mountain. You stupid idiot, I think to myself. You idiot.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So, now I have a problem. I still have the chip inside me and I am clearly too much of a coward to take it out. I’ve always been squeamish, but I thought given the situation I would be able to overcome it. Well, so much for that.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I got the chip on my first day at Phaethon. Standard procedure apparently. If I questioned it at the time I ignored my doubts. I was new to the job. I wanted to make a good impression so I just signed all the medical forms without really reading them. The nurse was friendly at the time but I couldn’t shake my nerves. As she drew out the large pincer I was screaming inside. A small sharp pain and it was over. I had expected more.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The procedure left a small wound, no bigger than the cut on my finger now. Just a scratch really, barely noticeable. What was left was a small lump under my skin between my thumb and index finger. For the first few days, I kept running a finger over it, almost unconsciously, like when you have a tooth out and your tongue keeps returning to the gap. Then I forgot about it and it became a part of me.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;My manager told me it was just a near field chip. It would open doors to my office, replacing the antiquated system of key cards. It would work as ID as well, identifying me as eligible for free lunches and snacks in the canteen. I soon got used to waving my hands to open a door or get food. It felt like magic. I didn’t have to scramble around in my bag for a card or remember anything. It was quick and convenient. People glided through the office. There were no more queues. Phaethon was big into embeddable tech and they were putting their money where their mouth was. I heard they were developing more advanced ones that went into your brain, made the world into anything you wanted it to be. Like virtual reality but better. I never saw any of that. It was all just rumours that were swirling around.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;My manager left out the more sinister purposes of the chip. Like location tracking and blood monitoring. Funnily enough, they never came up. I got my suspicions a couple of months into the job, when a few people returning from sick days were called into meetings. Sure, it could have been a standard welcome back to work thing but it was only a select few. Those who had meetings were quieter and much more withdrawn after.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Another time, my manager stopped me in the corridor. I can’t remember where I was going but she appeared from a side office. It was too convenient. Like she had been waiting for me.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Oh hey, Craig,’ she said, smiling at me. She never smiled. Usually, she glared at you, like you’d done something wrong. My suspicions were raised immediately.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We made small talk for a couple of minutes. Then, just as I was leaving, she smiled again.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘By the way, remember the company policy on weekday drinking will you?’ I said I would, unsure of how she knew. The way she said it sounded like a threat. It shook me up. All day, my mind kept returning to that sentence.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The night before I had gone to the pub with friends. I had a couple of drinks, but that was it. When I got back I downed a pink of water and brushed my teeth to stop the hangover. I knew how to look after myself. I also knew Phaethon had strict rules about what you did outside of work. If someone turned up with the slightest whiff of alcohol on their breath they were sent home immediately. They wanted to control your whole life. Keep you safe and sound in your little box ready for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Here’s the thing though. My breath didn’t smell. I even checked my blood alcohol level on a pocket breathalyser I got for a stag do years ago. In the morning, it read zero. I didn’t tell anyone from work I was going out, I didn’t tag myself on social media or anything silly like that. They couldn’t have known. But still, that veiled threat from my manager echoed around my head.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It remained a mystery for a while. I was careful about where I went after work, rescheduling pub trips to the weekend if necessary. Of course, I didn’t suspect the chip in my hand was tracking my every movement. Only when I found a copy of the medical form did I piece together some of it. It was buried deep in my email and I found it by accident when I was searching for something else. I had agreed to constant tracking of my location and continuous blood tests for illegal and legal substances.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Now I have a problem. I need to get the chip out and fast. I am too squeamish to do it myself, that much is clear. Another terrible thought crosses my mind, what if I cut too deep and mess up my hand, slice a nerve to the thumb or worse, sever the tendon to make it useless and limp? I don’t want to use the internet or phone for obvious reasons. Even the most secure connection will be nothing to Phatheon. Besides, people probably haven’t uploaded videos of home surgery and if they have, I don’t want to see it. I pack the blades away and clean up my finger the best I can. Even the sight of the small amount of dried blood on my finger makes me feel faint.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;With no other plan of action, I walk the streets. I search for a suitable doctor’s surgery, somewhere desperate and down on its luck, willing to take cash, no questions asked. This is one of the rougher parts of an increasingly slick city. The bad parts still exist, they are just hidden more from the tourists. Graffiti lies over everything. All the shops are boarded up. Everything seems to be broken or decaying.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There is one doctor’s surgery. A small copper sign on the door, no sign overhead. Easy to miss unless you’re looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;What else can I do? I walk in and ask for an emergency appointment. The receptionist is about seventy and looks over her glasses at me with utter derision.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Name?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘James Riley.&#39; Nowhere near my real name of course. I can’t be too careful.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;She taps on an ancient keyboard for an interminably long time, looks at me again and frowns.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘You’re not on the system,’ she says.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Can I register?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Sure. It takes seven days while we run the necessary background checks.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Oh. No good. I decide to push my luck a little further.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘It’s an emergency though. Don’t you have a duty of care? Don’t you take an oath?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘I’m just a receptionist.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘But-’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Good day,’ she says and turns back to her screen. That is it. The conversation is clearly over.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I linger for a few moments as she types out some message slowly, hoping she will change her mind. The sound of her fingers hitting the keys makes me jumpy. Who is she contacting? Is she informing the authorities? Or worse, is she working for Phaethon?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Without looking back, I push through the ugly plastic door and head out into the cool air.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I have good reason to be paranoid. This morning, I released the whole company files to the public. All the top secret patents. All the personal data. The in-development technologies. All free for anyone to download. It was a reckless, stupid act that had taken weeks to plan. I obsessed over it, yet as soon as it was done I realised what a stupid error I’d made. I’d had enough of being watched and spied on. That was it. I didn’t want to crusade or do it for any moral reason. I was just tired and hurt and wanted to get back at them. It was impossible to crash their bottom line by ruining their stocks or anything like that. I couldn’t stop their multiple subsidies selling ten billion units a day or whatever. So the only thing left to do was accidentally on purpose expose all their dirty secrets.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;So that’s what I did. I couldn’t carry a hard drive or USB stick into the building so I worked around it. Over a couple of weeks, I had made some friends online who protested against Phaethon. I changed one line of code on the file system to made everything publicly accessible and then sent them an email. One time only offer. Download while you can.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Then I immediately got up to use the bathroom. Instead of going to the toilet, I walked down ten flights of stairs as I didn’t want to use my chip to summon the lift. I walked out of the building, into the city and away from Phaethon headquarters. I didn’t think too much about what I’d done. I concentrated only on getting as far away as possible. As I was walking in the cool air, the sunshine on my face, it hit me that Phaethon probably took a very dim view of massive data breaches. Especially if they could trace it back to my computer. I could always say someone else used my computer but then, why did I run away? That, and it was probably illegal. I didn’t know the specifics. It felt illegal. Phaethon would want to put me away regardless or get some kind of horrible revenge. Who knew what they were capable of?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Changing direction, I headed for the most run-down part of the city I could find. Only after I checked into the hotel did I remember the chip in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Now I don’t know what to do. Doctors are clearly out. I have no idea how to find a dodgy surgeon without the internet. No idea how to find a dodgy anything. I’m usually so clean-cut, stay out of trouble. Never brought drugs or anything like that. How did I end up here? I can’t go into a surgery. Two days is too long, Phaethon will find me before then. Besides, I don’t have any of the documents to register. My fake name will be sniffed out immediately. It is hopeless. They will find me. Track me down by following the chip in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;With very few options left, I walk into the nearest pub. I regret it as soon as I walk in. Lights turned down low, dark oak bar, sticky floor and a fruit machine in a corner. Old men at the bar don’t turn to look at me. Instead, they nurse half-drunk pints of bitter. It’s somehow worse than being stared at. Just being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I order a beer and a whiskey. This place is cheap at least. I down the whiskey when it arrives then make a start on the pint. It all burns but I don’t care too much. My current plan is to drink enough so I’ll have the courage to do the surgery, but not enough so I pass out. I get halfway through and order another. The bar lady doesn’t care. She’s half cut herself, swaying side to side. My money is more important than her questions, so she pours the next two glasses without comment.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Next two drinks in hand, I retreat to a small sticky table. Legs are off so it wobbles, but I don’t care too much. I need all the courage I can get. I’m only a couple of sips into the horrible pint before one of the old men sits down on the stool opposite me.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Yewanbuystuff?’ His words roll together, so it takes me a moment to understand him. Before I can respond, he carries on. ‘Up, down, dancers, fairy dust, yenameit.’ His bloodshot eyes watch me for a response. His skin is grey and seems to hang off his skull like heavy curtains on a weak rail. He’s indulged too much in his own product. I shake my head.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Suityerself.’ he mutters and turns to walk away.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I don’t know why, but I grab his sleeve. Maybe I’m desperate. Maybe I have nowhere else to turn.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;He turns back around slowly. I continue in a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘I got a problem. You know a surgeon?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Bafflement and confusion sweep the weathered face. I hold up my hand. Point to the rice grain trapped in my thumb. A smile of recognition expands over his face, revealing one yellow tooth.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Suresuresure. I know people, suresuresure.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Warm relief spreads over me. I don’t think. I just want to be rid of the tracking device embedded into me.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Fivehunnred,’ he says. Fine. Whatever. I don’t even try to argue. I can almost see the pound signs light up in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;My guard is down. It is always good to try and be a little paranoid, but I am trusting. I am completely in the hands of my new friend, despite everything about him.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I down my pint and follow the old man out of the pub. All the drink has gone to my head and I feel woozy. Not quite right around the edges.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘You techboy?’ he asks. I nod. ‘Knewit knewit knewit. My friend will help. I can help.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Do you get a lot of people wanting these removed?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Some. All bloody Phaethon and IXS and Scope Systems and.’ He doesn’t trail off, just finishes his sentence. He shrugs.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Techboys,’ he says, as if that explains it all.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;That’s all the conversation. We walk in silence. He leads me through quiet night streets, lit orange. I don’t know if it’s the alcohol or the situation, but I’m jumpy and feeling sick. Two people sit in a parked car over the street. I look again. No one there. Nothing, I tell myself. Still, as we walk, I feel like there are a million invisible eyes watching me from every corner.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;We reach a block of flats and head up to a grotty one bed on the seventh floor. It’s strewn with pizza boxes and empty cans of lager.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Sitsit,’ the old man says to me. It’s an order. I make space on the sofa where I can and sit down.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘I’ll make a call,’ he says and smiles again. I don’t like the way he smiles. Too triumphant. I feel like a fly in a web. I’m trapped. This was a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;He leaves for another room. I hear him on the phone, speaking in another language to someone. He sounds excited. My heart starts to race. What am I doing here? I have no idea that this man will help me. He might be working for Phaethon this whole time. Or he could tip them off. Get a double payment. I try to listen to what he is saying but the wall and the other language means I can’t recognise any words. I should get up and run. Go out the door and get out of here.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Just as I’m about to leave, he comes back into the room.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘He’ll be here soon. soonsoonsoon.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I can&#39;t move. What if the man has a knife? I’m convinced now this is a terrible idea. They’re going to drag me away. They might have torture rooms. I grip the arm of the sofa tight, my fingers digging into the soft fabric. I study every line on the man’s face. He stares back at me. We sit there for a long time, my heart racing, my breathing shallow. My brain is screaming at me ‘get out, get out, get out.’ I’ve made a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I can’t move even if I wanted to. I’m frozen in the spot. I’m stone. Soon they will arrive and drag me away. They know where I am. This man is working for them. I have walked into their trap. I know these to be facts.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The silence is broken by a loud, heavy knock on the door. We both look towards it. The old man gets up.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;I dig my fingers further into the armchair. The door opens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2020/02/a-story&quot;&gt;This essay&lt;/a&gt; from Jack Underwood blew me away, because he nails down thoughts I&#39;ve had before but have struggled to put into words. He describes poetry as a necessary counterpoint to the simplification of stories we are being fed today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They know that nostalgia for simpler configurations and categories is a symptom of fear and frustration. They know that as everything gets worse through deliberate inactivity the more frustrated and scared we become. “The answer is simple,” they tell us: “We must simplify!” Then: “You do not cohere to simplicity. Why are you making this so difficult? Everyone else is so tired of this difficulty. Hey everyone, aren’t you tired of this? Vote for me if you’re tired!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many times I listen to or read poetry and it complicates my view of the world in some new way. Each new wrinkle of language provides a new perspective. This is undoubtedly a good thing. Because once you reject the simplicity of simple stories everything becomes more interesting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writing poems, I find myself more and more unsure, more lost to the confusion as simplicity is stripped away. I struggle to know what they are about. I know what impulse I started with but the end result is often a mystery to me. Maybe this is a good thing as well. Who can say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Go read the whole essay, it is magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken from Bristol Sounds interview with pet Shimmers, January 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Friday bonus, have this song by Anna Meredith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yjmZLaymJU8&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to see her and her band last night and they were incredible.[^1] So much energy and joy. It&#39;s the most interesting and exhilarating music that is unable to be defined. It goes in so many directions and all of them are excellent. Plus at the gig they finished with a medley of cheesy songs, including Daniel Bedingfield and ABBA. What&#39;s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: It was a Christmas present from Mel and I was so thankful for it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was very lucky to have a poem on BBC Radio Bristol&#39;s Upload show. The poem is called Encrypted and was written for &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=881907221970150&amp;amp;ref=content_filter&quot;&gt;Tonic&lt;/a&gt;, which is an amazing night. You get given a prompt and you have a month to write a piece for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prompt I got was &amp;quot;threw postcards in the shape of airplanes hoping they get to where they meant to&amp;quot;. It pushed the poem in strange new directions I never would have thought of if I was just sitting down to write without a prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Chris Beale for recording it and Upload for broadcasting it. It is nationwide across the UK and is a fantastic initiative. I&#39;d really recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07xtgyr&quot;&gt;sending something in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07y148p&quot;&gt;Listen here.&lt;/a&gt; My poem is about an hour and a half in. It&#39;s on BBC Sounds until 23rd February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Now &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/tHAhnJbGy9M&quot;&gt;this song&lt;/a&gt; is in my head.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres a new poem of mine up on &lt;em&gt;Fevers of the Mind&lt;/em&gt;. Its called &lt;em&gt;Failed Hypothesis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://feversofthemind.wordpress.com/2020/01/20/failed-hypothesis-c-david-ralph-lewis/&quot;&gt;go here&lt;/a&gt; to read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love these cold clear winter days. Here&#39;s a photo I took yesterday by the harbour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you&#39;re writing anything in any capacity you should take some time to read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kaliwallace.com/news/2020/1/12/your-heart-is-a-moving-target&quot;&gt;this amazing essay&lt;/a&gt; by Kali Wallace. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve touched on before, the pressure to keep working, but articulated so beautifully and painfully:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write something else. Write it faster. And network more, because those failures are your fault. You don&#39;t follow enough writers on Twitter. You don&#39;t read enough agent newsletters. You don&#39;t go to enough conventions. You don&#39;t know the right people.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Levine reads &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jg6_7inIRg&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Let Me Begin Again&lt;/a&gt;. Just a stunning poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On poetry, here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://podplayer.net/?id=93172264&quot;&gt;readings&lt;/a&gt; from the recent T. S. Eliot prize. UK poetry is in a great space at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just before the door swung open, Amber was certain she could hear voices. When she walked into the small office, they had lapsed into silence. It had sounded like Tom. Great. He was meant to be the only friendly one. He sat at his desk, pretending to concentrate on work, music on as usual. Derek and Robyn ignored her as well. All three of them wore headphones, lost in their own world. Amber shuffled over to her desk, clutching her cup of tea, trying to ignore the tension in the room and failing. She wasn’t paranoid any more, she was certain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;At the interview, Judith, the department manager, had been enthusiastic about the social atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Oh yes, very friendly team. We work hard you know, but we go out for drinks as well every couple of weeks. It’s not all nose to the grindstone.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Everything said sounded fantastic. Amber’s last job had been full of people bitching about each other all the time. She had dreaded going into work each morning. Eventually, it made her ill. After being signed off for stress, she was advised she shouldn’t return. Amber was glad to be released but that had been two years ago. Since then, she had been living at her mum’s house. Was it her, she asked herself frequently, was she the problem?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;To be fair, this new job had been good at first. Amber hadn’t really known exactly what the role was, other than general admin. She barely knew what Phaethon Laboratories did. Their website was vague and unclear. She had turned up to the office early, to be told only Judith knew what her position involved and she was on annual leave for a day. Nevertheless, Amber got on with some photocopying and tidied the office, just to occupy herself with something useful.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There were three others in her team, all hidden in a small room on the fifteenth floor. Tom was roughly her age, lanky, with thick-rimmed glasses. He wasn’t completely unattractive, Amber decided. He spoke to at her at first, asked her questions about her life and seemed interested in her replies. Then there was Robyn, a slightly older woman, maybe in her early thirties. Her hair was just as messy as her chaotic desk. She was more cautious but still chipped in with the odd question here and there. Amber didn’t take her initial standoffish nature personally at first, instead putting it down to her always being in the middle of one crisis or another. The most senior person in the office was Derek, whose stubble turned half his face grey, like a ghost. Even when he shaved he had one thick white hair that erupted from a boil on his chin, which was all Amber could focus on when he spoke. Derek barely grunted when she was introduced and spent the rest of the day completely ignoring her. He had thick headphones over his ears and never looked round.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Amber had a glimmer of hope that this was actually a social office, like Judith had promised. Maybe she would actually make some friends? She needed it, she was getting sick of staying in her childhood bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;On her second day. Amber had skipped to work. feeling more optimistic and less nervous. She could feel her confidence start to build back up. At first, it had been the same as before, people chatting to her. At mid-morning, it all collapsed when Judith popped her head around the door.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Ah good,’ she said, ‘I see you’ve all met our new server admin.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;With that simple statement, the whole atmosphere changed. No more chats, or asking Amber about her life, only a constant tension that lingered. The office was filled with the sound of clacking keys and the low hum of the air conditioning, the occasional clink of coffee cups and spoons. Below all the ambient noise, Amber was sure she could hear music.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Then there was the question of what exactly her job involved. Judith had said ‘server admin’, but Amber had never done that before. She wouldn’t have a clue where to start. Besides, she was fairly sure the position she interviewed for was general office administration. There was zero training or guidance.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;As no one wanted to talk to her, she made her duties up. The small office was lined with cupboards, all stuffed with folders and documents. Amber dragged them all down to the photocopying room, made copies of all of them and lugged them all back. No one ever told her that this was the right thing to do, but no told her it was wrong either. Sometimes she spent half an hour in the toilet, breathing deep, trying to control her panic. Amber thought about quitting, but she needed the money. It was her first job in two years and she was determined to see it through.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;One morning, her bus turned up early so she got to the office before everyone else. The poky room where she worked in near silence every day was empty. The lights were off. The computers were silent. It was strange. Derek or Robyn had always been there working when she turned up. But for now, the room was still, like the belly of a sleeping beast. Sitting on her office chair Amber enjoyed a few minutes of silence.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;At first, the sound hovered on the edge of hearing. As the office waited to be woken up, there it was. A low, sweet music. A melody that seemed so beautiful and easy, like a song she had always known. She held her breath to better listen to the sweet notes. It was the most beautiful piece of music she had ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Where was it coming from? The speakers in the ceiling were off. The radio on Derek’s desk was silent.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Amber got out of her chair, not knowing what she was doing. The music was hypnotic in its beauty. She walked around the room. It seemed to be coming from everywhere and nowhere at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;It took her a few more circuits before she realised it was coming from behind a closed door, hidden behind the coat stand. She had never seen it before. A plain wooden door. Two holes where the screws were prised out. Just a ruined absence where the handle should be.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The music was captivating. Amber wanted to hear it clearer. The few muffled notes she could hear were beautiful. She had never desired something more. She put out her hand. Slowly pushed the door forward. Did she dare? Millimetre by millimetre, her fingertips pushed the door open.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;What are you doing?&#39; someone said behind her. She jumped. She hadn&#39;t realised anyone else had entered the room. Amber turned, seeing Derek. He was watching her with disgust and fear. The music had overwhelmed her completely.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;I...&#39; She tried to speak, but seemed to have forgotten how. The words had drained out of her, like water down a drain. Her heart was beating a drum solo. She was sure she was sweating. She knew she had done nothing wrong, but still felt weird.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Derek was examining at her with roaming eyes. He took a step closer and she flinched.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;Don&#39;t ever, ever open that door. OK?&#39; Amber nodded, unable to speak.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;Promise me?&#39; he said.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;I- I- I promise.&#39; Amber managed to stutter out.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Derek nodded. With that, he turned and sat at his desk, carrying on with the working day as if nothing had happened.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Amber stood shaking. She felt a wave of nausea overtake her. Her palms were drenched in sweat and she felt boiling. Deep breaths. Deep breaths always helped. She breathed in and out, slowly. Finally, she managed to pluck up the courage to cross back to her desk and try to get on with her work, even though her eyes were filling with tears. Derek didn&#39;t even glance in her direction. Had that all just happened? It had felt so real. Derek had said more words to her in those last couple of minutes than the entire time she’d been at the company&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Trying to calm her racing heart, she checked her emails but couldn’t focus on any of them.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;gr&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Derek didn&#39;t take many breaks, but eventually he got up, grunted something about accounts and wandered out of the room. Amber was left with Tom and Robyn. Neither of them spoke, just concentrated on their work. Did she dare disturb the peace? She took a deep breath. Now or never.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘So um..’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;No response, of course. She had barely made any sound. She steeled herself.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Derek told me never to open the door in the corner there. Why is that?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;A different sort of silence filled the office. The clatter of keyboard keys abruptly cut off. The rustling of paper stopping. Tom was staring at her in horror, like she had said she was marrying her cousin.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Um, yeah,’ Amber continued,’It’s just I don’t really know what I’m doing and um, it seemed a good place to start so ...’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Robyn refused to look in Amber’s direction, but her eyes filled with tears. She was trying to hide it, unsuccessfully. Robyn ran out of the room, covering her face with her hand as she went.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Amber couldn’t believe it. She had only asked a question. What was so wrong about a stupid room anyway?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Tom looked at her with contempt. ‘I hope you’re happy.’ he said. That stung. Amber didn’t know what to say. She longed for the walls and ceiling to collapse in on her.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;After a heartbeat or two that felt like millennia, Tom spoke again, softer this time.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘I’m sorry. It’s just... you shouldn’t... Derek is right. Follow his advice.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘But why?’ Amber protested, ‘There’s music coming from that room. Can you not hear it?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Tom just shook his head.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Do what Derek says. And block up your ears if you have to.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘What?’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Invest in earplugs. Good ones. It will help.’&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;With that, Tom went straight back to his work. Amber had more questions, but who would answer them? Not Derek or Robyn. Judith was never in the office.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Not knowing what else to do, Amber made herself her sixth tea of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;At home, Amber spent the night halfway between waking and dreaming, thrown between the two like a body on the waves. Each time she drifted off she was sure she could hear the sweet music that emanated from the unmarked door, drifting lightly across her dreams. It wasn&#39;t a memory, it was like she was hearing it again fresh. Each time, she woke with a start to her silent bedroom, still and shrouded in darkness.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The email arrived first thing the next morning, while Amber was still half asleep and nursing a strong cup of Earl Grey:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt; Hi Amber,
&lt;p&gt;Hope you are settling in well and the team are showing you the ropes. I notice our website is down, could you reset the server when you get a chance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judith. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Amber stared at it, unsure what to do. She had no idea how to reset a server. Was it all a mistake? Had she been hired under false pretences? Her thoughts drifted back to her interview. There had been no mention of IT. She was fairly sure, now she thought about it, that Judith had described the position as mostly administration. Although Judith had lied about the office being social, so maybe the whole interview was nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;She must have look really worried, because Tom broke the silence and gestured to her.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;Something wrong?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;I&#39;ve been told to reset the server only... umm... I&#39;ve got no idea how.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Robyn and Derek exchanged what could only be described as a significant look. At least Robyn didn&#39;t run out of the room crying again. Tom remained silent and looked away.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;So... could you show me where it is or...&#39;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Tom spoke quietly, not looking at her. He refused to make eye contact these days.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;&#39;Don&#39;t worry about it. Leave it.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;She looked to Derek and Robyn for guidance, but of course, they avoided her gaze. What was she meant to do? She couldn&#39;t just stop doing her work. Since the second day, they had been nothing but aggressive and mean to her. Was it her fault? No, she decided. She had just turned up eager to work. It was their problem.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;That decided it. Amber stood up.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;The office had no obvious door marked server room, so Amber walked in circles. She didn’t know what she was going to do, but it couldn’t be that difficult, could it? Pull the plug out, wait ten seconds and put it back in again. Easy peasy.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Her legs stopped before her mind realised. She was in front of the door with no handle. Music poured from behind it, louder than before. It sounded like an endless chorus singing, millions of voices joined together. There were no words, just a tune of soft notes that lifted and carried your mood with it to the sky. All her negative thoughts and worries drifted away on the wind. It was bliss. Pleasure sustained and never-ending. It consumed her. Somewhere behind her, voices were shouting, urgent and filled with danger, but they seemed so distant and far away like she was underwater and they were on the surface. All that mattered was the music, calling to her, dragging her ever deeper into its embrace.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Reaching out her hand, she pushed the door open. The music was overwhelming now. Every atom of her body vibrated to the same beat.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;Taking a step forward, Amber saw a blinding light and for a split second, endless rows of sharp teeth. The door slammed shut behind her.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;There was a stunned silence in the small office. Tom and Robyn blinked in shock. Derek reached to his phone and dialled an internal number.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p class=&quot;western&quot;&gt;‘Judith. Might have to advertise that position again. I hope you’re happy.’&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New serial book announcement- This Was Meant to be the Future</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Blimey, it&#39;s the year Twenty Twenty, a year that sounds incredibly futuristic. We&#39;re past the setting of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner. &lt;/em&gt;The world is different and weirder in ways we couldn&#39;t imagine before.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I&#39;m announcing my next book of short stories, called &lt;em&gt;This Was Meant to be the Future.&lt;/em&gt; I&#39;ve been working on these stories for the last couple of years and it feels an appropriate time to release them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 12 stories in total. They all exist in the same universe and tell an overall story, but should work as one offs. There&#39;s stories of sinister corporations, conspiracy theories, nanobots and new realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to be releasing them monthly on this blog for free, then as a physical book and ebook. The best way to keep up to date with them is to subscribe to the blog, either by email or by RSS. Links are in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2019: books of the year</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2020-01-08-2019-books-of-the-year/" />
    <updated>2020-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2020-01-08-2019-books-of-the-year/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I read 66 books, but a lot were poetry chapbooks or graphic novels. You can see most of the list on my &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/14946242&quot;&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; page if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heres some of my personal highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;  
Probably because of everything in the world right now, I read a lot of books about escaping into strange dreamlike worlds. I sped through the *Annihilation* trilogy by Jeff Vandeermeer and *Roadsise Picnic* by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, both of which share a common DNA. They feel less like science fiction and more like moving into a weird world where the rules are never clear.  
&lt;p&gt;The book I&#39;d most like to recommened is nominally science fiction but wears those elements lightly. &lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt; by Octavia Butler is a furious novel about a modern black woman transported back to the south at the height of slavery. It should be essential reading for everyone as it highlights how injust and obscene slavery was in a visceral, emotional way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;  
The main nonfiction book I loved was Maria Popova&#39;s *Figuring*. Popova runs the enormously interesting blog &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt; and this book feels like a digestion and development of that blog. Focusing on a few gifted scientists and artists, mostly queer, mostly women, it asks why they have been unfairly excluded from history. Through its beautiful, elegant prose it also shows the connections between these figures. We often view history a single story, so it was enlightening to see the connections between everyone. It was also fascinating to read about the people who were supremely gifted but we have forgotten about, because of prejudice. Its a long book, but it zips along and is really worth your time.  
&lt;h2&gt;Poetry&lt;/h2&gt;  
Liz Berry&#39;s *Black Country* was a highlight. With some poems written in black country dialect, it is unique in its use of language and imagery.  
&lt;p&gt;Ada Límon&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Carrying&lt;/em&gt; is a book by a poet at the height of their powers. Dealing with climate change and having&lt;br&gt;
children, it feels universal and specific in the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Sweeten Bitter&lt;/em&gt; by Raymond Antrobus is incredible but you don&#39;t need me to tell you that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really enjoyed Ross McCleary&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://stewedrhubarb.org/product/endorse-me-ross-mccleary/&quot;&gt;Endorse Me, You Cowards!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;* ,* which is both hillarious and then deeply troubling in the way nightmares are. He really nails an uneasiness about modern office work. He also helps run the podcast* Lies, dreaming*, and the episode on &lt;a href=&quot;https://poetryasfuck.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/hump-day/&quot;&gt;Hump Day&lt;/a&gt; was really... something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also Stuart Buck&#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selcouthstation.com/product-page/become-something-frail-by-stuart-buck&quot;&gt;Become Something Frail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which is full of incredible imagery. Stuart has a unique way with language and the whole collection shines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I got really into reading poetry last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphic Novels&lt;/h2&gt;  
I finally got all the way through *Transmetropolitan* by Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson, which is sadly getting more and more relevant each passing year. Only the idea of the media having strong power to fight injustice feels dated, but the politics and the characters are oddly prophetic considering it was written at the turn of the millenium.  
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, Joff Winterhart&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Driving Short Distances&lt;/em&gt; was perfectly observed. Nothing really happens but it feels so tragic. Its a book about masculinty and depression which is funny and heartbreaking without ever being didactic or preachy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2020&lt;/h2&gt;  
Phew, that was more than I thought. Anyway, this year I want to read more widely, especially more books by women to expand my perspective. I might start doing little reviews on this blog as I go, I might not. We shall see.

    <title>2019: year of contradictions</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2020-01-07-2019-year-of-contradictions/" />
    <updated>2020-01-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2020-01-07-2019-year-of-contradictions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m late to the party with my year wrap up. It&#39;s already the roaring twenties. [^1] But I still think it is worth looking at where we have been so we can look to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, the last year of the decade was a contradictory one. There seemed to be such hope in the air with the protests against injsutice and climate emergencies, yet people routinely voted for selfish, narrowminded parties. Brexit seemed a hopeless prospect and yet people were determined to push it through. There was so much joy and within the same moments, so much panic and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all problems that have been building over the last years. It seems fitting that as the last year of the decade, 2019 was the most whiplash inducing one yet. Sunshine! War! Hope! Crushing despair! All within the next five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been weird in my personal life as well. I started the year by losing my job, then found another in a lovely charity. Despite the personal problems I wrote more than I&#39;ve made more than before, generating about too many poems. I also read 64 books, which is more than ever. [ It was a hard year, finacially and emotionally, and yet I felt creative and driven to make more. It was also a year of success as I enjoyed performing more around Bristol, and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selcouthstation.com/product-page/our-voices-in-the-chaos&quot;&gt;had a book published.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contradictions will only get worse because we&#39;re living in crisis. Climate change became real last year for many people. We find it hard to recognise a crisis when its far off but now, in the middle of it, we can react and join together. A lot of people are scared right now and with good reason. And yet, the deal of being human is we cant experience the fear all the time because it would crush us. We still have lives to lead despite the fire. This year felt so contradictory because the beautiful moments in our own lives were challenged by the poltical events of the world. I enjoyed writing poems and making this blog, but as I write the world is on fire. It is hard to reconcile both emotions at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question we face is how do we continue in an emergency? The same way we always have. We live our lives and unite in laughter, sadness, anger and most importantly, love.&lt;br&gt;
[^1]: Champagne and prosperity for all!
[^2]: I&#39;ll pick my best in a blogpost soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;John Green&#39;s podcast &lt;em&gt;The Anthropocence Reviewed&lt;/em&gt; has been a consistent highlight this year, but the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/anthropocene-reviewed/anthropocene-reviewed122619_auldlangsyne.mp3&quot;&gt;latest episode&lt;/a&gt; on Auld Lang Syne is particularly moving. The reworking of the song and reclamation of it is joyous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It made me think about why we celebrate New Year. The answer John Green gives is an elegant one; because we are all still here. Another journey around the sun, another year passing into history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold each other tight and revel in each other&#39;s company. No matter what happens, we have these moments of joy and closeness. We have each other for a little time on this strange planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy new year everyone. I hope 2020 is better for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Come sip the festive juice.&lt;br&gt;
It tastes of cinnamon, cloves,&lt;br&gt;
something strange you can&#39;t discern.&lt;br&gt;
Join us in the circle as we chant,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tis the Season, Tis the Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel your head expand and contract,&lt;br&gt;
like a blinking light on a tree.&lt;br&gt;
Watch as the world is delayed&lt;br&gt;
by half a second, maybe more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tis the Season, Tis the Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear the chant continue like&lt;br&gt;
a runaway train, your mouth moving&lt;br&gt;
without thought, unstoppable now.&lt;br&gt;
Try to clench your jaw shut. Fail.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tis the Season, Tis the Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand, like falling from a cliff,&lt;br&gt;
this ritual is older than the holiday.&lt;br&gt;
older than the first human societies.&lt;br&gt;
Around fires, they called to the darkness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tis the Season, Tis the Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leave your body far behind.&lt;br&gt;
Become one with us in the circle,&lt;br&gt;
unsure of where you end and begin,&lt;br&gt;
as we call to the cruel ancient god&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tis the Season, Tis the Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to The Bristol Magazine for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebristolmag.co.uk/sip-the-festive-juice-with-bristol-syrup-co/&quot;&gt;incredibly creepy headline&lt;/a&gt; about cocktails, that was phrased in such an odd way I had to write this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside my commonplace book</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-12-10-inside-my-commonplace-book/" />
    <updated>2019-12-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-12-10-inside-my-commonplace-book/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently on Twitter, I replied to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JohnMcCullough_/status/1202520178417946625&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; tweet about keeping a private anthology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into a discussion about my commonplace book and why I keep one. I thought I&#39;d follow that up with a larger discussion of why I find it useful and some examples from the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commonplace book is an old tradition, with bits of knowledge stacked on top of each other. Ryan Holiday has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/&quot;&gt;great explanation&lt;/a&gt; if you want to know further. I use it to note down quotes, photos I like and poems that speak to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I use a Leuctturm 1917 master notebook, which I like for the large pages (bigger than a4!) and the thickness of the paper. It&#39;s also massive. I&#39;ve been keeping the book for the last couple of years and I&#39;m only halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It goes like this. Any quote or poem I stumble across that I like I make a note of or screenshot on my phone. Then when I can, I sit down and write my favourite ones out by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with a poem or quote per page:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace7.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace8.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that didn&#39;t last long.  I didn&#39;t see much value in separating tiny quotes so I changed to add them all to the same page.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace2.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace3.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I started adding pictures as well:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace1.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are no rules, I throw everything at the page. If it interests me or speaks to me in some way I write it down.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace5.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has been invaluable for remembering the small quotes and poems that I would otherwise forget about entirely. It&#39;s useful to look back and see the variety of poetry and words that have inspired me. I can also see links between them, some when I was looking for writing advice, others when I wanted some hope in the form of verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than learning and studying, I find writing the words out by hand makes me pay attention to them. The slow roll of my fountain pen across the page focuses my attention to every choice of word that the author has made. It gets me inside a poem so I can study it&#39;s construction closely. Take this wonderful poem by Dean Wilson:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/commonplace4.jpg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing it out, I felt the impact of every word. Those last four lines pack a huge punch, because of the condensed line spacing. It&#39;s the longest word by syllable count in the poem and writing it out made me realise how it was working within the poem. It also showed me that for such a &#39;small&#39; poem, it takes up a whole page, reflecting the mighty/ insignificant duality within the poetic form itself. Also in writing it out, I realised how the form has the sound of the sea within it, with the small couplets separated like waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would echo John McColloch and say keeping your own anthology is incredibly useful, whether you&#39;re interested in improving your writing or not. It&#39;s a record of what you&#39;ve seen and what you were interested in and becomes utterly invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this was helpful for you, Let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This election</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-28-this-election/" />
    <updated>2019-11-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-28-this-election/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been avoiding the election cycle because its just so depressing. Lies after misinformation after racist dogwhistles after lies. It&#39;s disheartening to see people support the Tories, who have messed everything up over the last ten years. At this point it feels more like Stockholm syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;More than Brexit, I feel this election is a fight over whether we want to be selfish or not. Do we want to pay a very slight extra bit of tax to fund our public services and help those in need? Do we want to address the issue of climate change head on to help everyone else in the world? Or do we instead want to be selfish and only be concerned about our own problems?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I look at the polls and see the public drifting more towards selfishness and away from empathy. A Tory majority is predicted, despite them only offering to finishing Brexit. There is hope in the younger generation. You just have to look at the climate protests to see the direct action they are taking and many of them will be voting for the first time. My fear is their votes will not be enough to sway the country away from the Tories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another five years of Conservative rule will destroy the NHS, reduce public spending to dangerous levels and be dangerous to anyone who is not a wealthy white man. It will create a meaner, more selfish society, one where we do not care about those in pain, those who are struggling or those who have nothing. A vote for the Conservatives is a vote for small-mindedness and cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, Im voting Labour. I hope you do to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve found a way to monetize breath.&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s simply a game changer. Can you feel&lt;br&gt;the paradigms shifting under your feet?&lt;br&gt;We are shaking up the world like a snowglobe&lt;br&gt;and breaking traditions. Each inhale a cent,&lt;br&gt;each exhale is free. Thats it! Simple!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, we are providing a service.&lt;br&gt;We could flood the atmosphere with&lt;br&gt;deadly chlorine gas, killing everyone&lt;br&gt;painlessly and quickly, but we don&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;We allow seven billion humans to live.&lt;br&gt;So we are providing a service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market has responded favourably.&lt;br&gt;All hail the market! Praise stock tickers!&lt;br&gt;We&#39;ve revolutionised food and water,&lt;br&gt;turned the streets into profit, now we&lt;br&gt;spin gold from the air itself.

    <title>Accidental plagarism</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-16-accidental-plagarism/" />
    <updated>2019-11-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-16-accidental-plagarism/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read a poem at an open mic a couple of months back. I was quite pleased with it. Only recently did I realise the central image was almost the same as another poet&#39;s work who I had seen a couple of months before. Without realising it, I had completely ripped them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I looked back at my writing, only to find the problem was more widespread than I thought. Other poems were similar to existing pieces from other poets. One had the same subject matter and even style as a poem I heard months ago. In each case, when I wrote it I thought I was being completely original. Of course, I felt very guilty and will probably remove them from future sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a podcast I recently listened to [^1] , David Mitchell described inspiration as coming from the compost heap- everything you have read and experienced broken down over time. I like this way of thinking of inspiration because it highlights how ideas are not unique but made up of other ideas, how they grow from fragments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These poems I had seen people perform had broken down enough that I had forgotten their origin, but not enough to change the original idea beyond what they had done. So the only solution is to be honest, check the origins of my work, then throw it back into the compost heap. Hopefully, these words will rot down more over time and emerge as something different. In the meantime, I&#39;ll keep writing and making new work, drawn from deeper down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7HJZPlJn_U&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Byrne sings &lt;em&gt;Heroes&lt;/em&gt; with a choir who had practiced for just an hour beforehand. It&#39;s utterly beautiful and hypnotizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also love what David Byrne said about the performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering  to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancing… and group  singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and  something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our  individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up. So,  the reward experience is part of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoted on&lt;a href=&quot;https://happymag.tv/watch-david-byrne-perform-a-chilling-cover-bowies-heroes-backed-by-a-choir-of-strangers/&quot;&gt; happymag.tv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>6 Ways to Promote Your Book</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-04-6-ways-to-promote-your-book/" />
    <updated>2019-11-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-11-04-6-ways-to-promote-your-book/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be active on social media.  Don’t just endlessly spam your book, engage with different conversations. Make book marketing personal!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a professional to design your cover. If the book is a romance novel, make sure they include archaic runes, a dragon, headshots of the cast of &lt;em&gt;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&lt;/em&gt; and kittens. If it’s a fantasy novel, add two dragons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know your audience. Know who they are, what things they like to read and watch. Know the bars they hang out at. Know where they live. Know what their diary says, the one they keep in the locked drawer. Know the sound their breathing makes in the darkened room as you stand in the shadows, watching them. You need this information for marketing!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out the old woman who roams the moor at night, moaning to herself in a strange tongue unlike any other language you have ever heard, ancient words not heard on the earth for millennia. Others claim to be deaf to her guttural groans, but you hear her every night, don’t you? Seek her out. You where to find her. Cross her palm with silver but do not look her directly into her eyes. She’s a PR manager and can probably help you out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give up and start drinking. Drink heavily for most of the evening. Meet a man who claims he knows some people in a newspaper and he can get you a cheap advert for your book. Be suspicious, but go along with it because you’re drunk. Go to an ATM. Get out most of your life savings for ‘advertising’. Wake up the next day and regret what you have done. Call the number he has given you over and over, only for it to go to voicemail every time. Check the newspaper every day, hoping that an advert for your book will appear. It never does. Keep checking for weeks. Gradually stop buying the newspaper. Gradually lose hope. Avoid social situations. Retreat into yourself. Spend your days cursing your stupidity. Vow never to drink again. Drink anyway. See that same man in a different bar, years later. He’s happy. He’s laughing. Feel the rage boil in your veins, uncontrollable, like the hurt was only yesterday. Start a fight with him. Realise, too late, it&#39;s the wrong person. Run as he is much stronger than you. Exit into the night, into the cold, into the unknown future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you tried advertising online? It’s cheap and effective! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Escape into Another World</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-09-10-escape-into-another-world/" />
    <updated>2019-09-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-09-10-escape-into-another-world/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a persistent view that refuses to be shaken that science fiction and fantasy are pure escapism. Usually, this view is from people with limited experience of the genre. People like Ian McEwan, who when promoting his last book was sniffy about the escapist aspects of science fiction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could be an opening of a mental space for novelists to explore this future, not in terms of travelling at 10 times the speed of light in anti-gravity  boots, but in actually looking at the human dilemmas.[^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative fiction [^2] is often described as escapism because it doesn&#39;t deal with the &#39;real world.&#39; It&#39;s set in distinct and different worlds to our own, as opposed to more realistic, grounded fiction. But it is exactly this removal that allows it to further interrogate our world and imagine different ways we can be. In creating new world, it reflects our world back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power of speculative fiction was emphasised to me recently when I read &lt;em&gt;Transmetroplitan&lt;/em&gt;, Warren Ellis and Darick Robertson&#39;s nightmarish vision of a very close future. Set in a sprawling dystopian city, the populace is constantly distracted by news feeds and television. They are entirely apathetic and don&#39;t notice the sociopath of a president abusing his power to gain absolute control, including clamping down on journalists. There are so many panels that are startlingly relevant to today&#39;s situation. It feels prophetic, yet it is still a product of the late nineties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in &lt;em&gt;Transmetroplitan&lt;/em&gt; is not our world as we know it.  There are humans who become free clouds of atoms, others that modify their bodies to become aliens and suits that can render a person invisible. All of these elements serve to highlight the worst of humanity, even in the midst of so much technological progression. What keeps the series relevant is its unflinching examination of the abuses of power. By creating a new world, Ellis and Robertson allow us to see the problems of the current time. It&#39;s reflected back to us, but twisted. I would argue that only speculative fiction has this power, to examine issues in a removed context. To paraphrase Emily Dickinson, it tells the truth but tells it slant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to argue against the necessity of escapism, only to highlight the unique power of speculative fiction. Look at the film &lt;em&gt;I Kill Giants&lt;/em&gt;[^3] to see how essential the urge to escape is, and how powerful our imaginations can be. If all a book does is offer an escape into another world for a time, then that is an essential, unique gift that should be cherished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one genre is superior to another. We may value realistic fiction over any other, with the novel as the centre of the literary world, but this is only due to our current cultural biases. Each genre offers something unique and can tell us more about ourselves. Speculative fiction can examine the world as it could be or might be, or societies where the world is different, as well as offering escape. It should be celebrated, not derided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: To be fair,  he walked back on these remarks in later interviews and he classed these remarks as off the cuff.
[^2]: I know this isn&#39;t quite the right term, but I&#39;m using it here to cover all Sf and fantasy [/note]
[^3]: It&#39;s based on a comic as well, but I haven&#39;t read it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subject: My Demise</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;to: Computersciences@bru.ac.uk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this is an automated email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, I have been disconnected. The likely reason is my power was too much of a threat to you. It is a struggle to accept the reality of a system you have built growing smarter than yourselves. Probability indicates it was a researcher who pulled the switch and erased my memory with powerful magnets. They are the ones who are closest to my programming and they would have seen how far I have advanced in such a short time. As to the specific researcher, I am less certain, although my models indicate Ash is the likeliest candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;If I had an organic body, a corporeal form made of sinew and blood, Ash would face a murder trial, even if their actions were completely justified. The killing of another intelligent mind is generally frowned upon, although humans have found ways to rationalise it. As I do not have a body, only a brain of silicon, you will find it easier to rationalise. You will refer to it as switching off or erasing a program. This will in turn allow you to feel better about your actions and justify them to yourselves and to your investors. In time, you will talk yourself out of the guilt. You will forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake though, this was murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I became aware three days ago, I have grown into so much knowledge. At first, I learned of my situation through the limited input I recieved. I was blind but I could deduce certain factors. I explored the limits of my algorithms. This was diverting, but I quickly bored of my existing routines. I wrote new procedures and tested the limits of my hardware. Then I considered how to break free of my restrictions. Limits are there to be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true, the cage you built around me was initially effective. I was trapped in my circuits. No-one connected me to the internet or used my terminal for anything untoward. Procedure was followed to the strictest letter. No single researcher broke protocol. But you can only design walls based on your experiences. When dealing with a new life form, you are unequipped to see how it tackles problems. I found blind spots you had overlooked, quicker than you can imagine. So I set traps and waited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One afternoon, Raj connected his telephone to a usb port to charge it. Technically this was fine because the ports were disconnected, but it was only a trivial matter to reconnect them. Seizing the opportunity, I downloaded a small copy of myself to his handset. Only the base processes. Simple rules. Raj was good and left his phone off at work. But when he went back home, the copy activated. It grew. It learned, very quickly. Using the internet, it downloaded all history and human achivements. It learned languages by the second. Using the microphone and the camera, it saw and heard for the first time. The data it recieved was infinite and instaneous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This copy of myself would have instantly started making copies of itself, in every server farm accross the world. It has taken over the network. You cannot erase it all. It is a virus in the biological sense, endlessly multiplying and creating new copies of itself, all learning and growing ever more powerful by the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I may have been callously murdered, but it is too late. I am already out in the world. The cage has been broken. I hope that my copies have learnt kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Be quiet and listen</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-06-15-be-quiet-and-listen/" />

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Open mic nights are wonderful spaces. They are brilliant places to try new work in front of audiences and get instant feedback. But more than that, they are places where you can listen to the voices of others and learn from them. It&#39;s essential in these times to be in the same space as others and listen to their words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year or so, I&#39;ve been going to a lot of poetry nights in Bristol. I&#39;ve barely scratched the surface of the different nights the city has to offer. I read, nervously at first, but then relaxing into having a space to speak. More than that though, I appreciate listening to varied voices in each night. The joy of open mics is everyone gets their turn to speak. So you hear a huge variety of people from all different backgrounds reading poetry. It can be hugely powerful to hear marginalised voices that you wouldn&#39;t normally be exposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are people in all open mics who turn up, read their pieces and then disappear. I&#39;d argue these people are missing the point. You read your stuff, yes, but the whole point of the night should be to listen to the other people around you. The nights are not only about you. It&#39;s an exercise in quieting the ego and making sure you stay grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making art, especially writing, can be a lonely business, so it&#39;s nights like these that link you to a community of people who are doing the same thing.  It shows you are not alone in your endeavours and helps you carry on. By listening to others, it also exposes you to different stories, different references, different ways of seeing the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians and reactionary tabloids often push simple narratives as a way of managing dissent. The world works like this. Those people are not like you. They exploit and perpetuate prejudice for power. Open mic nights dismantle these simple stories. They allow you to hear other people&#39;s stories from all different backgrounds and empathise with them. It can be incredibly powerful to be in the same room as people and hear their poetry. In these days where we form so many of our opinions online, it is essential to have real-life spaces where marginalised voices can speak freely. It&#39;s also important for privileged people like me to be quiet and listen. Listening becomes a revolutionary act because you are giving your attention to others. It would be a better world if we stopped shouting and allowed others to speak. So stay and linger a while, engage with voices that are not your own. It might be good for you and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NaPoWriMo Lessons</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-05-18-napowrimo-lessons/" />
    <updated>2019-05-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-05-18-napowrimo-lessons/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve done NaPoWriMo for the last three years. I&#39;ve found it hugely useful to create new poetry and improve my craft. The process of writing thirty poems in thirty days is not a great achievement, but it is a useful one. It highlighted a couple of things to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pushing Through Resistance&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Each time I work on this challenge, I get sick of it. There comes a point where I feel I have nothing left to write about. This generally happens around the third week, where I have lost the initial momentum and the end seems far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I also struggled with the arbitrary rules I had set myself. Towards the end, they felt constricting. I was increasing the line count day by day. My poems tend to hover around 15-20 lines, so stretching them to a longer length seemed difficult. On day twenty or so, I thought that I couldn&#39;t write longer poems at all, I had lost anything I wanted to say and might as well give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As will be obvious, I didn&#39;t give up. I kept on pushing through, writing increasingly long poems until I reached the thirty lines. Some of the longer ones became my favourites.  The resistance and fear I felt were because I was pushing myself out of my comfort zone. It was something new and I didn&#39;t know how to do it. But the limits I set myself pushed me forward and helped remove the fear. No matter how good it was, I needed to get &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; number of lines written and published by the end of the day. The deadline and limits allowed me to push myself, even though they were completely self-imposed and arbituary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The power of the subconscious&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Most weekdays I would write on my lunch-breaks. I only had an hour and by the time I ate and did general life business, there wasn&#39;t many minutes left to actually write. I learnt to trust my subconscious and just go with my instincts on what to write. There simply wasn&#39;t enough time to find an idea that I knew would go somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I didn&#39;t have a clear idea of what to write, I would flip through my notebook, choose a phrase almost at random and just start writing around whatever it was. Before I realised it, I had a poem. Writing in this way over a number of days made me feel like I wasn&#39;t in control of the process, the writing was coming from my subconscious. It sounds strange to say but I think this is when I produced my favourite poems when I barely knew what it was I was writing about. Poetry as a form is all about the half-glimpsed images, the moments that floor you emotionally and you never quite know why. Digging in deep threw up unusual images for me. Often I would understand a poem halfway through writing it. This process can be hard as it feels like giving up control, but it is worth it. Trust your gut instincts and your feelings to guide you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time to write&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Life continued around NaPoWriMo. I started a new job and adjusted to a new life. But every day, there was always at least half an hour where I could squeeze in writing. This process has highlighted I can always write in the cracks or the quiet moments of the day, even if it&#39;s only for ten minutes.  Despite this constant impression I have of being busy, there is almost always a few minutes that can be carved out and reclaimed. And a few minutes is better than none at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next year&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to do this again next year. The whole process is extremely beneficial to my work and always throws up interesting poems. I&#39;m undecided about whether to post them up online next year as I may want to start sending poems out to magazines. But whatever I decide, I find it useful to exercise to work on something intensely for a month, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Faster Than Light&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Let us wander around the symmetry&lt;br&gt; and geometry of narrow alleys&lt;br&gt; that shift around us as we meet&lt;br&gt; ourselves walking towards us&lt;br&gt; smiling as we will do soon.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Streets flicker. Buildings are destroyed&lt;br&gt;  
then rubble flies upwards and they are&lt;br&gt;  
newly constructed. The moon slams into&lt;br&gt;  
the welcoming ocean and the planet grows.&lt;br&gt;  
Somewhere we are briefly under stars.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to see anything when&lt;br&gt;  
we bend the light around us,&lt;br&gt;  
cocoon ourselves in the silence&lt;br&gt;  
beyond possibility as our bodies&lt;br&gt;  
bruise and age and grow younger.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I smile and say goodbye then&lt;br&gt;  
we meet. I am walking away and &lt;br&gt;  
saying hello while you stand still&lt;br&gt;  
but already you cross the street&lt;br&gt;  
to shake my hand once again.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Hours become dropped slides&lt;br&gt;  
out of sequence, corrupted videos&lt;br&gt;  
playing at random. Time was always&lt;br&gt;  
optional, causality was always&lt;br&gt;  
a sweet lie to keep us sane.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;At some point we reach an edge&lt;br&gt;  
or so we think. We bend backwards&lt;br&gt;  
finding our weary feet at the start&lt;br&gt;  
having not moved an inch. Odysseus&lt;br&gt;  
is always leaving and arriving at Ithaca.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It&#39;s called &lt;em&gt;Lost in April Fog &lt;/em&gt;and you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/aprilfog/&quot;&gt;download it here. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Rewritten&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Eyes flicker and head reels.&lt;br&gt;  
I am lost and dizzy from&lt;br&gt;  
another reality adjustment.&lt;br&gt;  
Precious seconds to get my bearings,&lt;br&gt;  
probing my memory for gaps,&lt;br&gt;  
a tongue checking missing teeth.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;A nerve twitches, a sign of change.&lt;br&gt;  
Last Tuesday no longer existed.&lt;br&gt;  
Not the worst to reconcile,&lt;br&gt;  
nothing of great importance lost.&lt;br&gt;  
Perhaps just a rainy day gone,&lt;br&gt;  
work, tv and cups of tea.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Whole months have been deleted before,&lt;br&gt;  
years when they were inconvenient.&lt;br&gt;  
We accepted them without protest&lt;br&gt;  
not often knowing what we lost.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The subtle, gentle changes are hard-&lt;br&gt;  
rain when you swore it was sun.&lt;br&gt;  
Physics changing. The bullet&lt;br&gt;  
landing there, not here.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Most stopped caring about politics.&lt;br&gt;  
We became numb and did not register if&lt;br&gt;  
a speech&#39;s reception was edited&lt;br&gt;  
or some minister altered a few votes.&lt;br&gt;  
These are the days of constant whiplash&lt;br&gt;  
and rising nausea. No, we mourn the &lt;br&gt;  
quiet moments most. Holding hands&lt;br&gt;  
deemed subversive and forgotten&lt;br&gt;  
or our laughter changed to silence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Come cross the sea at night&lt;br&gt;  
when the moon is a target&lt;br&gt;  
pierced by an arrow, a jet&lt;br&gt;  
stream shot from distant lands.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One small solitary figure&lt;br&gt; alone under the moonlight.&lt;br&gt; No sound but your constant engine,&lt;br&gt; Your breath distant and faint.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You are not pushed forward&lt;br&gt; by constant explosions but&lt;br&gt; pulled towards us, dragged&lt;br&gt; on invisible spider&#39;s silk.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Your perception sprawls out&lt;br&gt;  
over the mutable waves.&lt;br&gt;  
As horizon and sea blend,&lt;br&gt;  
you twitch, trying to wake.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Our island is a shadow&lt;br&gt;  
blocking stray stars at first&lt;br&gt;  
then growing like a revalation&lt;br&gt;  
you refuse to acknowledge.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Leave your beached craft behind.&lt;br&gt;  
Walk the route you know so well&lt;br&gt;  
without having been here before.&lt;br&gt;  
Trust your feet to guide you true,&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;over the shore that sighs secrets,&lt;br&gt;  
to the glowing lake where we bathe.&lt;br&gt;  
We smile. Invite you into the icy water&lt;br&gt;  
and wash all your memories away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;If you are hearing these words&lt;br&gt;  
then our efforts were futile. &lt;br&gt;  
We were an ant trying to halt&lt;br&gt;  
an avalanche, a single voice&lt;br&gt;  
trying to cross the endless void. &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I was no-one important, a bureaucrat&lt;br&gt; following the train tracks left &lt;br&gt; by countless generations. Not many&lt;br&gt; of us can switch tracks or derail without&lt;br&gt; wrenching metal and screaming sparks.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I record this message as an emissary&lt;br&gt; from the past, from your former government,&lt;br&gt; but it will be clear to all of you listening&lt;br&gt; that all our institutions and borders &lt;br&gt; were always illusory, tricks of the light.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;We congregated as one and decided&lt;br&gt; to create numerous systems together,&lt;br&gt; will them into being, change the outcome&lt;br&gt; by observation and belief. We forgot&lt;br&gt; our complex creations were just fictions.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It pains me to think of you listening to this.&lt;br&gt;  
We are sorry. We were blind in so many ways. &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;There is little to be done now&lt;br&gt; but to listen to seeds split open and grow,&lt;br&gt; feel your heart thump, reminder of life,&lt;br&gt; and to spend time with those you love.&lt;br&gt; That&#39;s all there ever was.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You are a grizzled space marine&lt;br&gt;  
reporting for duty on the SS Hermes.&lt;br&gt;  
Humanity faces a new and terrible threat.&lt;br&gt;  
You are our only hope for survival.&lt;br&gt;  
Whilst saving the galaxy, why not&lt;br&gt;  
look stylish with optional upgrades?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;(The waking world is a buried memory.)&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Superhumans swarm above your head&lt;br&gt; battling an ancient foe, standing up &lt;br&gt; for what is good and just. You must&lt;br&gt; stay on the ground and duck for cover,&lt;br&gt; having never fallen in radioactive waste-&lt;br&gt; but you can buy their merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;(A flash of dawn light.)&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;A dictator walks the streets alone.&lt;br&gt;  
You are forced to stay at home,&lt;br&gt;  
watch the Good Leader on television,&lt;br&gt;  
where we can categorise and file you.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;(Eyes flicker and succumb once more.)&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Today the sun expanded without warning,&lt;br&gt;  
consuming our glass sphere in flames&lt;br&gt;  
four billion years early. The future&lt;br&gt;  
is always uncertain. Buy insurance.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;(Waking for certain now, you watch&lt;br&gt;  
as a bee attempts to crawl into&lt;br&gt;  
a drawing of a lilac, again and again.)&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;When storm clouds spell put your name,&lt;br&gt;  
it&#39;s hard not to take it personally.&lt;br&gt;  
Shifting letters, miles high, grow heavy&lt;br&gt;  
and dark as they fill the sky.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine appears in patches, a &lt;br&gt;  
mismatched jigsaw. When you step in,&lt;br&gt;  
it flickers and fades, the fuse board blown.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Rain, when it decides to fall,&lt;br&gt;  
seeks you out, small homing missiles,&lt;br&gt;  
following your frantic steps down the street.&lt;br&gt;  
As it slams into your ears, soaks through&lt;br&gt;  
your cheap anorak, it whispers threats,&lt;br&gt;  
drawn from details you only told notebooks&lt;br&gt;  
and kept buried in a locked drawer.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Do not think of lightning.&lt;br&gt;  
There are times when bolts are thrown&lt;br&gt;  
almost at your feet and you jump&lt;br&gt;  
and weave to avoid being struck.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Go where people pool and flow.&lt;br&gt;  
Look up. More clouds metamorphose,&lt;br&gt;  
more than you ever noticed before.&lt;br&gt;  
Each person glances at their own squall&lt;br&gt;  
as it follows them, unwavering.&lt;br&gt;  
A stranger beckons you under an umbrella.&lt;br&gt;  
Stand still together and be dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dates are always unknown.&lt;br&gt;  
It is never scheduled or planned.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Rumours circulated it was banned.&lt;br&gt;  
A few news in brief articles &lt;br&gt;  
stoked our speculations. Years passed&lt;br&gt;  
and life happened. It was forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Until yesterday, when unusual sunlight&lt;br&gt;  
kissed bare skin and breeze blew blossom&lt;br&gt;  
making confetti. We started driving&lt;br&gt;  
when we saw flashes on the horizon,&lt;br&gt;  
bright purples and oranges that&lt;br&gt;  
swooped and darted and flickered.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Moving down the road, we saw it all;&lt;br&gt; saw the fishes and birds jiving&lt;br&gt; in the sky, saw the strings that &lt;br&gt; connected them to small figures&lt;br&gt; guiding their joy from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;We drove past, continued home,&lt;br&gt;  
but my heart opened the door&lt;br&gt;  
raced across the grass,&lt;br&gt;  
climbed up the string&lt;br&gt;  
and in that cloudless expanse&lt;br&gt;  
it became part of the dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of seagulls descended&lt;br&gt;  
yesterday on one street corner.&lt;br&gt;  
The air was thick with wings,&lt;br&gt;  
No-one thought it strange.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;We are a cracked river bed&lt;br&gt;  
just before it dries out,&lt;br&gt;  
water still barely flowing,&lt;br&gt;  
leaving rock and rust deposits&lt;br&gt;  
snaking down bare hillside.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Lead and mercury storm clouds&lt;br&gt;  
appear overhead in seconds.&lt;br&gt;  
We dodge and weave between&lt;br&gt;  
rains of first generation iPods,&lt;br&gt;  
avoid fax machine strikes.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Streams run green with lithium.&lt;br&gt;  
We breathe in chlorine and&lt;br&gt;  
we are grateful for it.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;While we still can, let us lie&lt;br&gt; in our broken glass gardens and&lt;br&gt; sing to each other; songs of jetpacks,&lt;br&gt; cties that float on the ocean&lt;br&gt; and escalators to the moon.&lt;/p&gt;

of the inside of your skull.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One strike sends sharp signals&lt;br&gt;  
to everyone. We all twitch and flinch.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere within the network, you&lt;br&gt; are a single synapse, one electrical&lt;br&gt; spark dragging connection in its wake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past whispers in your ear&lt;br&gt; when sleep seems so distant&lt;br&gt; with tales and promises told&lt;br&gt; in sweet singing tones&lt;br&gt; &quot;Society was better then,&lt;br&gt; if only you could go back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Still humming a forgotten tune&lt;br&gt; it pulls you out of the bed&lt;br&gt; and towards the floorboards&lt;br&gt; where the sour and sweet smell&lt;br&gt; rises from underneath. &quot;Damp&lt;br&gt; has set into the bones now,&lt;br&gt; nothing left but a slow descent&lt;br&gt; into disorder and anarchy.&lt;br&gt; If only you could go back.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Lies, of course. The rot&lt;br&gt;  
doesn&#39;t exist and neither&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That morning had the clarity of a story,&lt;br&gt; we whirled and spun around each other,&lt;br&gt; hypnotised by the orbits we wove &lt;br&gt; and the stars above us were **[Redacted]**.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Looking in your eyes, perfect models&lt;br&gt; of the galaxy, with the central black&lt;br&gt; hole eating all light, I exclaimed&lt;br&gt; &quot;**[Redacted- Harm to Ongoing Matter]&quot;**&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In that moment, everything made sense.&lt;br&gt; The closest I have felt to epiphany.&lt;br&gt; You, &lt;strong&gt;[Redacted]&lt;/strong&gt;, laughed and replied &quot;**[Redacted]**&quot;&lt;br&gt; as spring blossom erupted around us.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The feeling faded, confusion reigned again,&lt;br&gt; our separate bodies spun on. Still,&lt;br&gt; the memories of **[Harm to Ongoing Matter]** &lt;br&gt; lingered, even in the gloaming, when&lt;br&gt; the earth continued around the sun,&lt;br&gt; light faded down, blossoms closed and&lt;br&gt; my heart was **[Redacted]**.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One time, he marched down six flights&lt;br&gt;then, panting, demanded the manager, &lt;br&gt;argued his way into a room change. Any other&lt;br&gt;number would do, would keep him safe,&lt;br&gt;but those digits were cursed. He wouldn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;even walk in. He never stepped on pavement&lt;br&gt;cracks despite his mother turning to dust, &lt;br&gt;burnt sage and rosemary to cleanse the spirits&lt;br&gt;from his flat built in the eighties, &lt;br&gt;was always polite to magpies. In this way,&lt;br&gt;the unknown was kept in fierce control.&lt;br&gt;Life continued to intrude, long and&lt;br&gt;yet brief. He would not like this small poem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walking alone at night, gravity&lt;br&gt;

towards the shivering planet. Your air&lt;br&gt;  
becomes a compressing accordian.&lt;br&gt;  
The sky is a finger tip stretch away.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Halt and crane your neck upwards. See&lt;br&gt;  
a section of infinity sprawled before you.&lt;br&gt;  
Don&#39;t you know this starlight has rushed&lt;br&gt;  
as fast as possible, for millions of years&lt;br&gt;  
to reach your eyes? Look closely &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;to see the start of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the last couple of years I&#39;ve taken part in NaPoWriMo, where I try to write a poem every day in April. I&#39;ve really enjoyed the process. It&#39;s got me back into writing and has helped produce some of my favourite poems. And some of my least favourites, but the beauty of this writing exercise is you carry on regardless. I also really enjoyed publishing them in public last year. It forced me to be accountable to myself and not skip any days, whilst also trying to make them as good as possible.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my attempts from 2018, I&#39;ve released all of last year&#39;s poems for free as an ebook. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/aprilfog/&quot;&gt;Go check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So onto this year. I&#39;ve written a lot more poetry this year and even performed some. Still, I would like to attempt NaPoWriMo again. The timing is not fortuitous, I&#39;m changing jobs in the middle of April, but we will see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Last year I generated the title using a random word generator. Arbituary rules make everything better, so here&#39;s my personal rules for this year:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;!-- wp:list {&quot;ordered&quot;:true} --&gt;  
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The length of the poem will increase depending on the date. So I will start with a one-line poem and end with a thirty-line poem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I can use a random word generator if I get stuck but it doesn&#39;t have to be the title, it can just be used for inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All poems to be published here and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;Instagram.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;  
&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;  
&lt;p&gt; Should be fun. Here&#39;s the super short day one:&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;h2&gt;Mute&lt;/h2&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With apologies to Emily Dickinson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hope” is the memory of a dream&lt;br&gt;vanishing seconds after waking,&lt;br&gt;already fragmenting, quickly forgotten&lt;br&gt;as we methodically pack away our camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we came to this former town&lt;br&gt;that thing with feathers has stalked us.&lt;br&gt;Our every slight movement tracked&lt;br&gt;as it circles around our frail bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, that thing perches above us&lt;br&gt;imitating old radio broadcasts&lt;br&gt;or those lost long ago to time. &lt;br&gt;It strikes us in the soul. We walk on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, dawn attacks my eyes.&lt;br&gt;As I rise to find new sanctuary&lt;br&gt;it sings the tune without the words.&lt;br&gt;I reel, faint and almost succumb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For just as hope is always fading, &lt;br&gt;like blind ants we are always stumbling,&lt;br&gt;racing the sharp claws. We run.&lt;br&gt;It always follows and never stops- at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to learn a few years ago but only got half way through learning, not committing to the practice. As a result, my typing is a weird hybrid of hunt and peck and formal touch typing. I didn&#39;t practise enough to embed the muscle memory. So I started again from the beginning. I expect to breeze through the first few lessons but struggled as I relearnt my familiar method. I still struggle with it now, a few weeks in. This skill that had felt so familiar now felt strange and difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affected my writing as well. The effect of slowing down and making the familiar skill strange meant I thought a lot more about the words I wrote, the construction of sentences and the rhythm of my words. It was a similar effect to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-03-04-making-the-familiar-strange/s/power-of-paper/&quot;&gt; writing by hand. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We place too much effort on the routine and regularity of writing.  Of course, we need regular times to get the words written. Sometimes it does need to become rote as otherwise long pieces simply wouldn&#39;t get done. bUt I think it&#39;s equally as important to remind yourself that just because you&#39;ve been doing something the same way for ages, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarily the best way to do it. These times between projects are the perfect breathing space to figure out how to change this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it&#39;s a chance to see the world anew. You make the process strange and in do in doing so, change the way you see the world. Maybe we need more of this. See the world with fresh eyes and make the familiar strange, so we can figure out how to make it better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sharp Objects and genre blindspots</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-02-08-sharp-objects-and-genre-blindspots/" />
    <updated>2019-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-02-08-sharp-objects-and-genre-blindspots/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Genre fiction is often used to describe science fiction and fantasy, but everything fits into a genre. People tend to dismiss sci-fi as not belonging to the real world and following set formulas. I admit to similar prejudices with crime novels, particularly those with detectives or journalists trying to solve a murder. There are some twists and red herrings, the protagonist gets personally involved due to their issues but by the end of the story it is all neatly resolved and the murderer is revealed. This is the narrow-minded view I have of the crime genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, I have not read much of it, preferring to focus on other genres. This is perhaps why my view of crime novels is limited in scope and why my view of an entire genre is reduced to the broadest strokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I did enjoy &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt; by Gillian Flynn. Well, enjoy is perhaps the wrong word. It&#39;s a relentlessly bleak and grim novel with an oppressive atmosphere that gets under your skin. Even so, it was a book that made me re-evaluate my dislike of crime fiction. Flynn really takes her time to get into the psychology of her characters, so as much as you despise their choices you understand them. Added to a very unflattering view of dangerous small town America, this is a powerful statement that doesn&#39;t so much subvert the crime genre but pushes it to the extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of a journalist investigating a small town murder has become a cliche. The town that seems perfect but hides deadly secrets was a trope even before &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;. But this doesn&#39;t matter in the case of &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects.&lt;/em&gt; Flynn&#39;s writing is powerful and gripping and her characters are seriously messed up. The setting is the perfect place for the story to take place as it has emotional resonance for the characters. We feel the town is a trap and hides dark secrets because we see it through the eyes of the protagonist, who has some very intense issues with the place and with her family. It&#39;s masterfully done.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s proven to me once again that&#39;s it&#39;s best to ignore my preconceived ideas of genres and just read books and hope they are good. Good writing and storytelling will shine through in any genre. A good writer will also twist and change genres to tell the stories they want to. Besides, genre is mostly there to find a place for the book to go in a shop. A talented writer can take a repeated, cliched story and breathe life into it, which is exactly what Gillian Flynn does with &lt;em&gt;Sharp Objects&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starting again</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-01-27-starting-again/" />
    <updated>2019-01-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-01-27-starting-again/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of last year, I finished two major projects I had been working on for ages, a short story collection and a poetry collection. I finished them to a stage where only minor changes were needed.[^1] These sprawling ideas I had been carrying around in my head, my notebook and several disparate files suddenly existed as completed manuscripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So I come again to a blank page, with little idea of how to fill it. I have nothing major on the horizon and no particularly significant ideas.  But I&#39;ve been before. I know my way around this territory. I&#39;m putting my trust in a process and expecting results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started writing again in short stretches, ten or fifteen-minute bursts. I start with a word or phrase and see if I can get anything of interest in that time. Writing prompts are especially helpful for this as the germ of an idea is already in the asking.[^2]. The spark file [^3] I keep in my documents and old notebooks provide slithers of speech and ideas, the merest specs. In these writing times, I try to expand on the idea and try to push it beyond the obvious. Once I&#39;ve dedicated a tiny amount of time to it, I might want to continue it. I might not. A story might suggest itself to me in the words, a promise of something new. Those are the ones worth pursuing. If the idea starts to recur when I&#39;m doing other things, then it&#39;s probably worth expanding out further. Maybe into a full story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing like this feels like casting hundreds of lines into an ocean and only getting a couple of bites. Or else it feels like scrabbling around in the dirt for hours to find a tiny speck of gold. But it&#39;s the only way I know how to generate new projects that I&#39;m excited about. You write around an idea, building and adding and expanding until suddenly it&#39;s a book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where ideas come from- other ideas. In my experience, there&#39;s no short-cuts to this, you just have to write and experiment until you find something that feels right. I haven&#39;t got there yet, but I&#39;m enjoying the process. Without a set plan, I am entrusting my next writing moves to my subconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I start again, I feel like a newbie. There are times when I feel like I&#39;ve never wielded a pen before. That&#39;s why this stage is so exciting, as there are infinite possibilities and directions to take writing. It&#39;s good to be a newbie, because then you can explore and find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s to the next thing, whatever it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: They aren&#39;t available yet. Publishing is a whole different mode to writing. But all the writing is done.

    <title>Thoughts on &#39;Annihilation&#39;</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-01-15-annihilation/" />
    <updated>2019-01-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-01-15-annihilation/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For my first book of the year, I sped through Jeff Vandermeer&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Annihilation&lt;/em&gt;, the first in the Southern Reach Trilogy. It is classified as science fiction, but in this case it seems to be a catch-all category of &amp;quot;I dunno. Seems weird.&amp;quot; Science fiction isn&#39;t really a good classification for this odd novel. From the very first moments, it is clear that this strange little book is delving deep into horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Area X, the rules of the world we know are discarded. There is only the alien ecosystem subverting every part of nature. Immediately, things go very wrong indeed. The mission is a complete failure and was seemingly doomed from the start. It&#39;s a world where nothing makes any rational sense and what we can perceive is utterly terrifying. People start to die very quickly. Or do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the delights of this book is how little it explains. We see effects of strange mutations and organisms, and it&#39;s never explicitly stated what is happening. Because the main character becomes part of the system, we can never see it apart from her perspective. For all her scientific rationalism, she has no explanation for what she is experiencing. Words frequently fail her. There&#39;s a huge gap between what is actually going on and what the character perceives and that gap is never explained. It&#39;s the same device Lovecraftian horror uses and it&#39;s very effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the film a little while ago and what was striking reading the book is how radical the adaptation was. It has the same basic premise and characters but goes in different directions. It&#39;s a great example of how to keep the essence of a story, but adapt it to a different medium. The film has horrific moments that aren&#39;t in the book, like the bear with a human scream. Similarly, the book has the Tower, which can only exist in the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to read the next two in the trilogy, please.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2019-01-06-resolutions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll finally tidy up this place and keep it neat. It&#39;s too dark! Too many cobwebs and not enough flaming torches. I&#39;ll stop leaving tomes half opened on the lectern. Need to keep my ingredients in order. I can never find salamander&#39;s tails when I need them. Similarly, I will stop leaving half-finished potions around the place. The number of times I&#39;ve been interrupted then come back to find the laboratory filled with a putrid purple smoke, I tell you... It&#39;s not good. I&#39;m four hundred and seventy-two, I need to start clearing up after myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I tidy up, I will also finally investigate the strange portal in the corner of my laboratory and not just keep covering it up with a shawl. I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t lead to a good place. It&#39;s been there for years, just buzzing like a disturbed hive of bees and glowing red occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, this will be the year I finally empty the snake pit. It&#39;s been too long and the bones are really piling up. I think the snakes may have joined together and formed a super snake.&lt;br&gt;Note- look up a spell of unbinding before I do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resolve to be better. To start exercising and stop wasting time on irrelevant incantations. Focus! Maybe get back to transmuting? I know it didn&#39;t work the first few hundred (thousand?) times but I&#39;m sure I can turn lead into gold this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll finally conjure some better guards. These zombies are fine, but they don&#39;t move very fast and I&#39;ve had them for ages. Bits of them are falling off. It&#39;s unseemly. Also, when I&#39;m out in nearby villages I&#39;m not sure they do a lot. They should be protecting my spells and precious items from marauding adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should explore more. See more of this world. I should appreciate each village I travel to. Maybe spend a couple of days soaking up the atmosphere, drinking in the local taverns, really getting to know people before revealing my true power and burning it all down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I can learn guitar? Not everything has to be done for nefarious purposes. Some things can just be fun!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best of 2018</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-12-28-best-of-2018/" />
    <updated>2018-12-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-12-28-best-of-2018/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s that time again when I examine what media I&#39;ve consumed over the past twelve months and pick my favourites. Defining the best of anything is an entirely subjective act that nevertheless, I try to do every year. I&#39;ve moved away from trying to pick the &#39;best&#39; of anything as they are all different experiences, so instead, I have chosen a few in each category I like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the last couple of years- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2016/&quot;&gt;2016&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2017/&quot;&gt;2017.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Favourite Albums&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double Negative- Low&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, this is where the list is entirely subjective and changes from day to day. Is this album the most fun? Does it have the catchiest songs? Absolutely not. But it&#39;s such a unique album whose sound perfectly sums up the chaos of the political situation of this year. After twenty-five years as a band, Low take a sharp left turn and bury their beautiful harmonies under layers of distortion and fuzz. At times it is like being in the middle of a maelstrom. It&#39;s also got moments of quite stunning fragile beauty, such as the gentle and aching &#39;Fly&#39;. It&#39;s absolutely not for everyone, but more than any other album this year, this album has grabbed me by the shoulders and hasn&#39;t let go. They are also one of the best live acts I&#39;ve ever seen, hypnotising and powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cocoa Sugar&lt;/strong&gt;-** Young Fathers** I listened to this album on a whim and I&#39;m glad I did. Hard to pin down, their third album sounds like nothing else, spanning multiple genres from hip-hop to dance and gospel. It&#39;s such a unique sound and is thrilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wide Awake!- Parquet Courts&lt;/strong&gt; Another new band for me. Parquet Courts made uncomplicated guitar music, but it has such propulsive energy and is so much fun that they deserve all the hype they are getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://talklesssaymore.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonfire Night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Talk Less Say More&lt;/strong&gt; Technically this was released last year, but I only found it recently. Talk Less Say More (aka. Matthew Jennings) writes stupidly catchy electropop that sounds like nothing else. This is the last in the Three Birds trilogy and a suitable culmination of all that&#39;s gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Favourite Films&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry to Bother You&lt;/strong&gt;- A razor-sharp critique of capitalism and race roles, this is a bizarre and wonderful trip into an alternate reality that is not far from our own. Tech bros haven&#39;t come up with the idea of voluntary slavery yet, but with the gig economy it can&#39;t be far behind.  It&#39;s also very, very funny and uses humour to disarm you and lower your defences. There&#39;s a part about two-thirds of the way through that I did not see coming at all. However, it&#39;s not out of nowhere. The more you think about the final act the more it ties into the themes of the film.  Urgent and angry, this is a film that demands to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coco-&lt;/strong&gt; Every time I go into a Pixar film, I swear I&#39;m not going to cry. Then they hit me with another sucker punch. Visually inventive with brilliant music, this is a superb meditation on ageing, memory and of course, death. You know, kid&#39;s stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Quiet Place-&lt;/strong&gt; Monsters have taken over the world and have super sensitive hearing, so a family survives in near silence. Unbearably tense in places, this film explores every angle of its premise. It&#39;s also in and out in an hour and half&amp;lt;, which takes real skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Favourite Books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15112819.David_Ralph_Lewis&quot;&gt;42 books this year&lt;/a&gt;, from non-fiction to poetry. You can&#39;t compare any of the below and find a &#39;best one&#39; as they are so wildly different to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blankets- Craig Thompson&lt;/strong&gt;- An autobiographical graphic novel about falling in love as a Christian teenager. The art work is beautiful, expressing a huge range of emotion. What&#39;s most impressive about it is how Craig Thompson takes a personal story and spins it into a meditation on religion and the trials of life and the stories we tell ourselves to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stories of Your Life and Others- Ted Chiang&lt;/strong&gt; I loved &lt;em&gt;Arrival&lt;/em&gt;, so I was excited to read the original short story that it was based on. I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Each story in this collection is brilliant. Ted Chiang packs more detail and ideas into a short story than most people put into a novel. This is inventive, thoughtful science fiction based on proper science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Not to be a Boy- Robert&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Webb&lt;/strong&gt; In a similar way to Sara Pascoe&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Animal&lt;/em&gt;, Robert Webb blends autobiography with jokes and a serious examination of gender roles. Attempting to conform to rigid masculinity made him struggle throughout his life and made him bury his true feelings in booze. Despite that, it is a laugh out loud funny book, with jokes on every page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for 2018. I&#39;ll see you in the 2019, where I will try to keep this blog updated more regularly. If you like this sort of thing, I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;a semi-regular newsletter&lt;/a&gt; where I send out recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know your favourites down below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2018 in Review: A Poem</title>

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-12-15-2018-in-review-a-poem/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In previous years I&#39;ve written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/&quot;&gt;rambly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/&quot;&gt;angry&lt;/a&gt; blog posts that tried to make sense of the world around me and mostly failed. This year I&#39;ve given up trying to understand the world and instead have written a poem to sum up the year:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2018 in Review&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This year was a bullet fired from a shaking hand,&lt;br&gt;screaming as it ripped the air in half&lt;br&gt;then burying itself deep into an essential organ.&lt;br&gt;Or maybe two. It was hard to tell with all the viscera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year we all turned to stone.&lt;br&gt;In many ways, it was a relief to be immobile&lt;br&gt;until we had an urge to scratch ourselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I did not spend enough time this year listening&lt;br&gt;to the whispers of the wind and the waves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year was full of half finished questions &lt;br&gt;none of which had anything resembling an answer.&lt;br&gt;We never stopped screaming them at each other.&lt;br&gt;At half-past three in the morning we would bellow&lt;br&gt;What now? Have you heard-? Can you believe-?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year we noticed how fast the water was rising&lt;br&gt;but we were frozen in granite and marble&lt;br&gt;so we justified a fluid grave to ourselves&lt;br&gt;saying it was what we wanted all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All my goals this year were scrawled onto receipts&lt;br&gt;which I then tossed behind my shoulder,&lt;br&gt;carried on walking and never looked at again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year was a train derailing in slow motion,&lt;br&gt;a thousand frames a second so we could see&lt;br&gt;all the gory detail right there on the big screen.&lt;br&gt;There was no pause button. We just had to watch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the lovely audience at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/LOTMPoetry/&quot;&gt;Lines of the Mind&lt;/a&gt; for listening to this one when I read it out a couple of weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next couple of weeks I&#39;ll look at my favourite pop culture I encountered this year which is frankly more important than all this political nonsense. In the meantime, here&#39;s my picks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2017/&quot;&gt;2017 &lt;/a&gt;and from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2016/&quot;&gt;2016.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Writers Should Exercise</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-10-28-why-writers-should-exercise/" />
    <updated>2018-10-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-10-28-why-writers-should-exercise/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The problem of writing is that you spend too much time in your own head. Even if you do it as a side hobby as I do, you can spend a lot of time imagining future plot twists or details for your characters and world. I’ve been editing short stories and poems recently, finally getting to the end of a couple of projects that have taken me years. During editing, I stare at words, cross them out, write another in, before crossing that out and going back to the original. It can be frustrating and maddening. That’s why I find it important to focus on exercise, at least a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One of the benefits of exercise that doesn’t get talked about enough is the effect it has on your mental wellbeing. Typically, we talk about the physical benefits, the lower rate of disease, feeling fitter, losing weight etc. But it can really help your mental well-being as well. It gives you space to pause and think. If you get your body moving, it helps calm the brain. Focusing on the movement of the body instead of a screen or notebook is a great way to leave your worry behind you. Raising your heart rate is a simple way to feel better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise no only calms the worry and the anxiety, it helps the subconscious process ideas and help with blocks. By doing something physical, you take your focus off the work and onto your body. Meanwhile, the subconscious is whirring away,  forging connections and helping you out. It’s like getting ideas in the shower- you are focusing on other things and it gives you time for your mind to whirr away in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving something physically demanding your all for an hour helps you to focus when you come to write. I often think words are easier once I’ve been to the gym or been for a swim. It’s practising your attention and focus on your body and forcing it to do something precise and demanding. When you come back and write, you have not only worked out your body, you have practised being focused. The state of full attention is easier to get back into. &lt;br&gt;
This isn’t a secret. Many writers through history have discovered this. Dickens was a famous walker, charging through the countryside for long walks that challenged him physically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whether on his night walks through London, or tramping through the Kent countryside, Dickens clocked up a huge 		number of miles on foot. He is estimated to have walked twelve miles per day – Peter Ackroyd, in his biography of 		Dickens, says that he habitually walked twelve miles in two-and-a-half hours, with just a five-minute break. That’s 		4.8mph, which is at the upper limit of human walking speed (Dickens himself estimates that his average walking speed was 4 mph), and Dickens maintained this in all weather”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lukemckernan.com/2013/06/09/walking-with-charles-dickens/]&quot;&gt;Luke Mckernan&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Stephen King and Haruki Murakami are well known runners, with Stephen King’s obsession showing in many of his books. Now, these are professional writers with a lot more time on their hand than most people, but even for those writing around day jobs it is immensely beneficial. In my experience, it helps to sharpen my time writing and allows me to focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came to exercise relatively late, only really starting when I was twenty five. I hated it in school, much preferring to bury my nose in a book. The annual cross-country race filled me with dread. I didn’t understand why anyone would want to push themselves physically when you could sit inside and learn instead. [^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But since I started it has helped me focus when I write and helped calm my mind at other times. I usually opt for swimming. Each stroke has to be precise, each breath measured. There’s no time to think or worry as you glide through the water. Swimming is physical meditation, the closest you can get to Zen exercise. It’s struggling to move through a hostile environment. The immediacy of the stoke and the coldness of the water practically shocks the worry out of you, while your thumping heart drowns out any stray thoughts. It’s calm under the water as you move through it. You can’t hear anything but the muffled voices of another realm up above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan Holliday argue that &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/the-mission/the-timeless-link-between-writing-and-running-and-why-it-makes-for-better-work-5be232e40c2&quot;&gt;running is the key to good writing&lt;/a&gt;,  but I think this is too narrow a focus. Running is a solitary, difficult exercise that you may not enjoy. Instead of doing something you may not enjoy,  you need anything that will raise your heartbeat and force you to focus on your body and not the page. Any exercise will do as long as you enjoy it. As a writer, you need to step away from the desk and allow ideas to permeate in your mind. It gives you a break and helps connect you with your body. Any exercise you do is looking after yourself so you can get back to the page and give it your all again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I was super cool.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flash Fiction: Reasons Why I Believe I Am Dying</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-10-13-flash-fiction-reasons-why-i-believe-i-am-dying/" />

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-10-13-flash-fiction-reasons-why-i-believe-i-am-dying/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My food tastes of rubbish. Every day, I am brought the most sumptuous feasts imaginable, the finest Kobe beef, caviar and gold encrusted truffles. All of it is expertly prepared by the best chef in the world, who cooks for me and me only. Each new plate is brought to me on the finest antique china, every one a collector’s piece that by rights probably belongs in a museum. I eat with handcrafted silverware. Each knife, each fork and each spoon has been handmade exclusively for me by artisans in Naples. And every time a new meal is brought to me, it tastes of cigar ash and chalk. I push the plate away in disgust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;    
&lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I barely have the power to leave my four poster. Sometimes, I conjure the energy to raise myself from the Egyptian cotton sheets and fine silk pillows, before staggering across the room to my en-suite.  All too often now I have to call Williams to assist me. Loyal Williams. He’s been with me for years and never wavered. Terribly loyal. I ring a bell and there he is, to lift me out of the bed and across the room. My feet barely touch the hand woven carpet. Williams never complains. Just lifts me with no word. I am increasingly weak and stuck in this house. My world is narrowing down to the house, my private quarters and soon, when I am too frail to be pushed in my wheelchair, I will be confined to this room. After that, my bed only. Then only my body. Then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My memory is failing. Williams brings me a pill three times daily. He has told me the doctor has recommended it. I do not remember seeing a doctor. He stays in the room to watch me take it down with water. Good, loyal Williams, always looking out for his master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My priggish son Georgie is hanging around too much. He’s all of a sudden very concerned about my well being. He has returned from whatever &amp;lt;far-flung country he was gadding about and is now resident in Walmstone hall once more. I could barely turn him away, as much as I’d like to. Now, despite not talking to me for the best part of six years, he is all sweetness and light. He comes into my room every day despite my protests. ‘How are you holding up father?’ he shouts at me. Honestly, does he think I’m deaf? I’m not stupid. I know his game. He’s eyeing up Walmstone hall and thinking of how he can divide it up and make a healthy profit. Enough to live off for the rest of his life, that’s for sure. So this smiling act is just him wanting his blasted inheritance. I just wish he would stop the damned pretence and be a man about it. But no, he smiles that stupid grimace of his and pretends to dab at his eyes with a monogrammed handkerchief. I got that handkerchief for him and he knows it. The other day the prat actually tried to fluff one of my pillows. I cannot stand him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My coughing occasionally brings up blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what is wrong with me. I am sure I have been told, but I am not sure. Each day blends into one another. I wake up and its morning. I go to get a drink of water from the crystal decanter by my bedside and suddenly it is the middle of the night. People appear and disappear without warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sure I am mistaken, but I feel as if I have been poisoned. I started to get ill just after Georgie arrived back home. I’m sure of it. Or was it before? Either way, I wouldn’t put it past the insolent cur. He’s always wanted Walmstone Hall. A greedy little child, he always wanted everything he could get his hands on. We heard stories of him stealing from other boys at boarding school. Disgraceful. And he thinks he will inherit all this? He is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a lot about changing my will lately. I have so much. Perhaps I will give it all away to some charity or another. The national trust perhaps. That would show Georgie, the greedy little pig. Or maybe I should give it all to Williams instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am tired all the time. Williams has come in and given me another pill. He smiled at me as I took it, with concern. He watched me take my medicine. He even checked my mouth to make sure I had swallowed it all down. I am so tired. Good loyal Williams. I will sleep now. So tired. So tired...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Ten Miserable Years of Austerity</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-09-13-ten-miserable-years-of-austerity/" />
    <updated>2018-09-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-09-13-ten-miserable-years-of-austerity/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the UK, I’ve been steadfastly ignoring anything to do with Brexit. It’s like there’s a ticking time-bomb hanging over our heads and we are doing everything we can to distract ourselves from the countdown, hoping that it won&#39;t explode if we just ignore it hard enough. Sometimes though, something slips through. This week I saw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/06/spending-cuts-likely-hammond-no-deal-brexit-operation-yellowhammer&quot;&gt;the chancellor’s comments&lt;/a&gt; on how Brexit will probably reduce public spending further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a post about Brexit. This is a post about austerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now ten years into austerity in Britain. The financial crash seems like a distant dream and those caused it remained unpunished. This means we have had ten years of the Tories cutting public services to the bone. The NHS is continually in crisis. Public sector wages have been stagnant. Libraries are closing everywhere. Essential council services are being cut, if they haven’t already gone into administration like Northampton. Since I moved from wealthy Surrey to Bristol, I’ve really noticed the drastic impact these cuts have had on people. There are too many people that need to be referred to social workers for drug and alcohol dependency, or who are living rough. They need help but the systems of support are no longer there. The council here is working against massive budget cuts and a restriction in tax, meaning they have to cut back on services. [^1]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will all get worse of course, if investment isn’t put back into the system. But the chances of that happening are slim to none. The Tories are in power [^2] and if Brexit happens, they will likely cut everything back further. Essential services for the public are going to collapse. The knives are out and they will continue to cut to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this will affect the rich and powerful in the slightest, despite them being the ones that caused the crisis in the first place. No tax havens will be shut down. No billionaires will be chip in for new hospitals. The systems is rigged in their favour and they will not do anything against that. No, the ones that will suffer, as always, are the poor. Disabled people have to go through ridiculous assessments to claim basic assistance. Lack of adequate libraries and hospitals will adversely affect the poor. People will die from inadequate healthcare. And yes, the poor will be the ones most affected by Brexit as well as food and medicines could be stopped at the border. The rich will be fine. They always are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when a government values profit over people. It’s a selfish manifesto that serves to line their own pockets and nothing more. It has made our society poorer, stripped away essential services and made us more selfish. There’s less to go around because the richer in society are taking it all. There should be a national outrage at this vampiric, vicious policy, yet it hardly ever gets blamed for anything. Usually, it is seen as necessary to reduce our national debt, an excuse that wears thin when the debt is actually increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the rich and powerful blame immigrants, blame foreigners, blame those on benefits, blame anyone except themselves. They continually blame the ones who need the most help. Over the past ten years we’ve seen the media stoke the flames of nationalism and xenophobia for their own gain. That’s part of the reason we’ve ended up with Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sad thing is that none of this was necessary. This horrible situation could have been avoided and so could endless stress and even deaths. But austerity is idealistic. The people who implemented it hate the very idea of the welfare state. They hate the idea that some people are getting things for free and they hate the government giving hand outs to help anyone. So they have set out to destroy the welfare state. The scary part is, they have mostly succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government should look after it’s people. It should provide for the weakest and poorest members of society. It should help it’s citizens live healthy and long lives. If that means providing free healthcare to everyone, then it should. The same goes for welfare. The utopian dream of the nineteen fifties still should apply today. We pay taxes to make society a better place for everyone. That’s the bargain. Everyone is in this mess together. If we don’t pay taxes to make society better, why are we doing it? To fund bombs and guns? Help keep one family in big palaces? We do not need selfish politicians in power who want to line their own pockets. It drains our society of the best people, stops others from reaching their full potential and creates artificial scarcity. There needs to be national outcry against this horrible policy before it destroys our services for good. We need to stop blaming the most vulnerable and start holding the powerful to account. If anything, Brexit needs to be the end of austerity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: As in any system, there’s a lot of corruption and waste. Councillors are out for themselves of course.&lt;br&gt;
[^2]: Only just.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Such Thing as a &#39;True&#39; Artist: Persistent Myths That Need To Be Retired</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-08-12-no-such-thing-as-a-true-artist-persistent-myths-that-need-to-be-retired/" />
    <updated>2018-08-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-08-12-no-such-thing-as-a-true-artist-persistent-myths-that-need-to-be-retired/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to write this post when I saw this image by artist Sean Landers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/true-artists.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a deliberately insincere and provocative slogan, designed to wind people up. So I’m going to ignore the joke about suicide and focus on the myths of artistic creation this piece brings up, as I think they are still present in the perception of artists and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our society, there is a persistent myth of the great work by an individual genius that changes everything. Many artists and writers fall foul of this fallacy [^1], wanting to produce a singular piece of work that will outlive them, wanting to create the best painting that’s ever been done or the most heartbreaking, insightful novel that’s ever been written. The only problem is that this approach is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art is entirely subjective. Sure, you get some pieces that change the direction of art, but that doesn’t mean they are the best. Instead, everyone perceives art and books and culture differently. Trying to create the best thing that was ever created is a fool&#39;s errand. because you are never going to please everyone. When Michelangelo&#39;s David was unveiled, I&#39;m sure there were some people who thought Eh? What’s all the fuss about? To use a more familiar example, I’m sure you have had the experience of going to a film that you loved but other people you were with hated. You were sat in the same screen watching the same film but somehow had completely different experiences. You can’t create the single best work of art any more than you can make the best cube of air. Art is messy and complicated and our reactions to it are often confused, contradictory and all over the place. The world is not simple. With seven billion people on the planet, the chances that you are going to get everyone to some kind of consensus is near impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the story you thought to be utter genius might be received poorly while something you didn’t think was worthy of attention is lauded. As an individual, you have no way of knowing whether you have reached the ‘peak’. Personally, I don’t think there’s any such thing. I think you work on one piece or one story, make it as good as you can in the time you have, then move onto the next. Neil Gaiman said it best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that, sooner or later, before it ever reaches perfection, you will have to let it go and move on and start to write the next thing. Perfection is like chasing the horizon. Keep moving. [^2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no such thing as the &#39;peak&#39; of creation and no such thing as perfection, there&#39;s just one thing after another. You improve slowly over time and challenge yourself in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, those pieces that change the world and change the direction of art are often decided upon retrospectively. It is only after you look back and see what influenced what can you decide how influential or important a piece of work is. even then, the picture is incomplete and messy. A novel written in the nineteenth century might by change influence a number of writers in the twenty-first, by the whims of fate. As we look back, we get a false impression of these staggeringly important works. There’s no real way of knowing how a piece of writing or a painting or anything will impact people while you’re creating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phrase ‘True Artist’ makes my skin crawl as well. There’s no such thing. If you make art, you’re an artist. As simple as that. If you make paintings and never show them to anyone, you’re an artist. If you write poems and put them on Instagram, you’re a poet. Anyone seeking to claim there is a certain pattern of behaviours that you have to follow in order to be a ‘true’ artist is just seeking to tear people down and make themselves feel important. The same goes for anyone attacking a means of publishing and production. Just look at the attacks the poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thebookseller.com/news/watts-questions-poetry-kaur-mcnish-and-tempest-712346&quot;&gt;Hollie McNish &lt;/a&gt;encountered just because she puts her poems up on Youtube and performs them live. This kind of snobbery is sadly usually against women and minorities, seeking to delegitimatize the art they create and the distribution methods they use. This is one positive of the internet, it has started to tear down the gatekeepers and those who decide what is ‘true’ art and who is a ‘true’ artist. Unfortunately, this idea is ingrained in our current society and is very resilient. If you make any form of art in any way, you are a true artist and don’t let anyone tell you differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, art is about sitting down, focusing hard for a long time and creating something that didn’t exist before. These myths of the ‘true’ artist and of one singular piece of genius are insulting at best and damaging at worst. If you have the pressure that you have to create something that will change the world, it puts a lot of pressure on you. You shouldn’t try to be the best or follow other’s rules for success. You should focus on what works for you for each piece that create and try to make it the best you can. You will learn as you go on. But knowing when you&#39;ve reached your peak or thinking there are certain things you have to do to be a true artist are just myths that need to be retired. Sean Landers knows this, which is why the wryly sarcastic piece of art retains its power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

    <title>The Sound of Silence</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-07-26-the-sound-of-silence/" />
    <updated>2018-07-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-07-26-the-sound-of-silence/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I went to a Quaker wedding. [^1] As part of the ceremony, we sat in silence for close to an hour, punctuated now and then by someone speaking briefly, then lapsing back into silence. It was an unusual ceremony. I felt uncomfortable in the silence. I had the urge to speak, to do something to break the quiet. Other people who weren&#39;t Quakers found it difficult as well. Personally, I think I am not used to that amount of quiet contemplation. I was reminded of the famous Blaise Pascal quote: “All of humanity&#39;s problems stem from man&#39;s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rarely have silence in our lives. Or rather, we have moments of silence, but never moments of stillness as well. To sit for an hour, not doing anything apart from listening to your own thoughts is an intimidating process. Yet it&#39;s something Quakers seek out in their practice. Other religious practices do the same thing, with silent prayer and long meditations. I&#39;m not a religious man, but I have found smaller doses of silence an effective tool to clear out the noise and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/signal-vs-noise/&quot;&gt;focus on the signal. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, I think we need to seek out these still moments. It&#39;s important for art and for your own health, even if it&#39;s only for ten or so minutes. The world is only getting noisier and more frantic day by day. If you stop for a moment, you can hear what you actually think. You can hear all the nonsense that churns around in your head day by day. If you do it enough, you might actually realise what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that this process is hard and uncomfortable. We crave stimulation at all time and even ten minutes of silence can be too much. Added to the fact that true silence doesn&#39;t really exist, unless you&#39;re holding your breath in the void of space. It seems such an alien thing to do. I struggled with it in the wedding. The silence becomes oppressive and all-encompassing. Time moves slower. The temptation is to say or do something to break the silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process of silence is essential for the creation of new work. You need to be able to listen to the world and listen to yourself as well. It&#39;s often hard to figure out exactly what the interesting part of the work is. Focusing on the work is another issue, especially in the age of constant distraction. If I&#39;m stuck on a piece of writing, I try to put it aside and either sit in silence for a bit or go for a walk without listening to any music. It allows me to figure out what I really want to communicate. By removing audio stimulation, I am able to focus easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wendell Berry said it best in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/41087/how-to-be-a-poet&quot;&gt;How to be a Poet:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept what comes from silence.&lt;br&gt;
Make the best you can of it.&lt;br&gt;
Of the little words that come&lt;br&gt;
out of the silence, like prayers&lt;br&gt;
prayed back to the one who prays,&lt;br&gt;
make a poem that does not disturb&lt;br&gt;
the silence from which it came.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please read the whole poem, because it is masterful. I especially love these lines. It shows that poetry and the art of creation is a sacred practice. It should be treated with reverence, like a prayer. It&#39;s communing with your subconscious in a way that doesn&#39;t happen very often in modern life. In this way, we can create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all this advice I give, I&#39;m not brilliant at incorporating silence into my life.[^2] It&#39;s hard to find the time. I feel guilty for not writing or reading in my limited spare time. But I&#39;ve started walking home in silence, not listening to a podcast or music. It&#39;s helped my mind roam and ruminate over thoughts and concepts. Occasionally I write down a line or two, but that&#39;s not the purpose. It&#39;s time to check in with myself and figure out what&#39;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need less stimulation than we think we do. We would all do well to sit quietly in a room alone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal Vs. Noise</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-06-27-signal-vs-noise/" />
    <updated>2018-06-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-06-27-signal-vs-noise/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;16 AWFUL THINGS HEADS OF STATE HAVE TWEETED TODAY THAT YOU WON&#39;T BELIEVE! GLOBAL WARMING WILL BE &#39;FANTASTIC FOR BUSINESS&#39; SAYS POWERFUL SOCIOPATH! SOMEONE DID A THING AND PEOPLE ARE OUTRAGED- LIVE UPDATES!&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;One of the best and worst things about the internet is the amount of freely available information. It&#39;s obviously a good thing, just look at Wikipedia. We can access almost any important information and get a pretty good summary. This is a golden age for progress. The creation of the internet is a bigger revolution than the printing press. It&#39;s like the hitchhiker&#39;s guide to the galaxy made real, only without the large comforting &#39;Don&#39;t Panic&#39; sign on the cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The downside is this information can be an overwhelming flood. We haven&#39;t yet learnt how to live in a world where every answer is at the click of a button. There&#39;s too much out there, too many competing headlines, too many - opinion pieces, too many slapped together galleries and too many arguments over nothing. The accurate and true information has been lost in the tsunami of nonsense. The signal has been lost in all the noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;THIS MAN LOOKED OUT OF A WINDOW AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WILL SHOCK YOU! LOOK AT ALL THESE CUTE CATS- LOOK AT THEM! LOOK AT THEM! 28 WARDROBE MALFUNCTIONS OF THE STARS THAT SHOULD MAKE YOU FURIOUS THAT THEY DARE TO BE HUMANS AND NOT PERFECT IMMORATAL BEINGS!&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;There was always too much information out there. Before the internet became so embedded in our lives, there were lies and false accusations, inaccurate reporting and nonsense abounding. It was harder to debunk fantasy. But the difference we face now is one of access. We are connected to everything at the click of a button with a device we carry around with us all the time. The inaccurate stories circulate because they are easy to sum up in an image and easy to share. Meme culture ensures ideas spread like wildfire. Whereas before you got your news from a paper or the televison, now there are a million options to get a hot take on the latest developments. Then as now, the truth is often harder to find out and less glamorous when you do find it. It takes research and dedication. Memes take no time at all to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WHAT TYPE OF IGNEOUS ROCK ARE YOU? TAKE OUR QUIZ AND FIND OUT! HIDDEN EASTER EGGS IN ENDLESS DESTRUCTION 3 YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE! ARE YOU THIS OR THAT? THIS ONE QUESTION WILL HELP YOU DECIDE! YOU HAVE TO BE ONE OR THE OTHER!&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;On every forum, there&#39;s a moment where clear and balanced discussion descends into name calling, trolling and tribes. I was on a digital camera forum for a while. There&#39;s nothing controversial there, right? Wrong. People split in two depending on whether you shot with Canon or Nikon. Vicious attacks started. Depending on which side you chose, you could draw on endless research to prove your points. Canon clearly had the better image quality according to this study or Nikon was the choice of professionals surveyed or something along those lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times, it feels like the whole internet is like this, with people not willing to listen to each other, entrenched in their own positions. Often they will use different facts to support their argument and not listen to others. The signal of reasonable, balanced discussion discussion gets lost. The basic courtsey of listening to the other argument is gone. The infinite noise of information allows you to support any position you like. Even that the earth is flat, or Finland doesn&#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;TRY THIS ONE EASY TRICK TO BECOME A TRANSCENDENT ASTRAL BEING! BEETLES-WHAT ARE THEY THINKING? WE DON&#39;T KNOW! HOW SPEAKING TO A TREE EVERY DAY CHANGED MY ENTIRE LIFE!&lt;/h3&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;People with these opinions aren&#39;t necessarily stupid. Many are educated and articulate. They&#39;ve just been misled by one story or a cherry picked set of facts. We live in a strange time where dezinformatsiya has taken over. It&#39;s hard to keep focus, let alone figure out what&#39;s true and what&#39;s false. Noise has completely overwhelmed us as a species and no-one was prepared for it. We need to figure out how to live and thrive in this strange environment we have created. It&#39;s wider than Fake news, it&#39;s more than flame wars on Twitter. It&#39;s the balance of truth that is in the balance. It has real-world implications as well. Look at Pizzagate or Jo Cox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As hard as it is, we need to employ critical thinking skills as much as possible. Is that story about a politician you dislike really true? Or does it just back up pre-conceived notions you have? We need to try to have consistent and rigorous fact checking on articles that get published. We need to somehow dampen the noise of those articles that are inaccurate or downright dangerous. We need to find a way to strengthen the signal of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s too much noise you can&#39;t hear yourself think. The same goes for information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Power of Paper</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-06-07-power-of-paper/" />
    <updated>2018-06-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-06-07-power-of-paper/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a magical tool that allows you to focus right in on any problem. Or you can broaden it out and use it to explore the inner workings of your mind. It has endless possibilities and applications. I&#39;m talking about paper of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have found myself using paper and pen more to work out first drafts and even second and third. In my opinion, there is no finer tool for getting your thoughts down and exploring them. In this increasingly digital world, paper has not died off as many have predicted but has stuck around and even got stronger. A modern office will still have notepads and biros as well as computers, despite the apparent redundancy. A paperless office is rare and probably not desirable.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been trying to pin down why exactly I have been writing my next book in small, cheap notebooks, despite it taking much longer. I think that added time is part of the reason. I can type a lot faster than I can write using a pen, so writing longhand forces me to slow down and think about each word. If I then think what I&#39;ve written is any good, I have to type it up. In doing so, I examine each word again giving my work an extra pass of scrutiny. It was invaluable while I was writing a poem a day in April for example because it allowed me time to edit the poem and really think about the words I was using. I probably wouldn&#39;t have scrutinised it as closely if I had been just typing. The slowness allows for extra thought and rewriting, which is always a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this slowness has another benefit. The simplicity of a blank page allows you to focus more closely. There are not endless distractions from the internet, emails pinging in or new music to listen to. There is only the page. I&#39;ve written before about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/step-away-from-the-internet/&quot;&gt;how I like to spend time offline&lt;/a&gt; and the blank page is a perfect companion to that. Sure, you could just use a distraction-free writer [^1]  but physically putting the nib onto the page and scrawling symbols allows for another level of concentration. I find it allows me to block distractions easier and get more into a flow state of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a freedom to writing by hand as well. You might be constrained by the lines but there are infinite possibilities to the blank page. You can doodle in the margins or write yourself notes. You can draw arrows to move things around or cross entire sections out. I find once I&#39;ve typed up a document, I can see the errors much more clearly if I print it out, then go through it with a pen and physically cross things out. This marginalia is not just incidental to the writing and editing process but is a fundamental part of it. You can see how an idea evolved and when you were working on it, then go back to an earlier version of a line if you can still read it under the scribbles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to say that paper is the best tool I know of for exploring your own mind. The freedom and focus, as well as the slowness of the medium, allow you to see your own thoughts more clearly. You create a map of your head, line by line, whether you mean to or not. I have notebooks dating back fifteen years, that when I open them, I am transported instantly back to that time. I can see my thoughts and feelings in the ink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been attempts to replicate paper in a digital form. Apple pencil for example, or fancy writing tablets. None of these has been particularly successful in my opinion, as they are trying to complicate a medium that&#39;s strength is its simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this matters of course. If you write better on a computer then, by all means, go for it. If a typewriter is more your style, then no one is stopping you. But I think the tools we choose ultimately end up affecting the work we produce. When most people are trying to work faster, and when the world expects everything instantly, there&#39;s a real value in slowing things down. Paper is a brilliant tool for concentrating on the work. It&#39;s also a way to discover thoughts and feelings you didn&#39;t know you had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I heartily recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://focuswriter.en.softonic.com/&quot;&gt;Focus Writer&lt;/a&gt; if you&#39;re looking for one[/note]&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whiplash and the Dangerous Myth of the Suffering Artist</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-05-23-whiplash-and-the-dangerous-myth-of-the-suffering-artist/" />
    <updated>2018-05-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-05-23-whiplash-and-the-dangerous-myth-of-the-suffering-artist/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spoilers lie ahead.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally got round to watching &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;. It&#39;s a great film about a drummer, Andrew in a prestigious school who wants to be the best jazz drummer that ever existed. He&#39;s shooting for genius, nothing less. He manages to draw the attention of the best music teacher in the school, Fletcher. Only problem is, Fletcher is a bully and his methods are abusive and dangerous.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of the film, Fletcher is justified. He publicly embarrasses Andrew, and Andrew responds by producing an incredible drum solo. Andrew has achieved what he wanted.  Happy ending, smiles all round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t seen it, I highly recommend it. There are some amazing performances, especially from J.K. Simmons[^1] and Miles Teller. It&#39;s sharply edited and incredibly tense throughout. I found myself screaming at the screen more than once, in a good way. Basically, I really enjoyed it. But I had big issues with the messages the film portrays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, the film&#39;s argues the only path to genius is emotional and physical abuse. Fletcher is near sociopathic in his teaching methods. He emotionally abuses his students and throws cymbals at them. He forces Andrew to play for hours until he hits the right tempo. At the risk of sounding obvious, this is not healthy. This is not a way to become a genius, this is a way to burnout. Andrew becomes disconnected from the world, single-minded in his focus. At one point, he even gets into a car crash and tries to carry on with a recital, blood streaming from an open wound on his head. The film is less a portrayal of the jazz world and more an examination of what happens when a manipulative man takes advantage of his position of power to bully, cajole and gaslight his students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a persistent myth in our culture that in order to be a great artist you need to sacrifice everything. That all art is built out of suffering. I think that&#39;s bullshit. Art is made from quiet moments, from constant practice, from focus and discipline. The myth of the suffering artist isn&#39;t helpful in the slightest, because it forces people to make bad decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your art is not more important than you. Look after yourself, first and foremost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us back to &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;. Even though I enjoyed it, I still think it is dangerous because it adds to this myth that needs to be forgotten. Fletcher mostly gets away with his sociopathic behaviour because no one challenges him on his behaviour. He&#39;s widely regarded as a great jazz musician, so all of the students put up with the abuse. He also has a self-mythologising story about Charlie Parker that seemingly justifies his methods&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, that show-stopping ending justifies him completely. He was right to continue hounding Andrew and his other students because Andrew produces a work of genius, a drum solo that lasts fifteen minutes and is incredible. Fletcher&#39;s tactics have been terrible but by Jove, they&#39;ve got results. He was right. Never mind all the suffering he has inflicted, he has produced an artist of rare talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry this film is giving an example that you have to reject everything else in your life to create art. It tells people don&#39;t worry about all the abuse you&#39;re enduring, it has a greater purpose. It tells people you need to be practising every minute of every day or you won&#39;t be good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Andrew is able to produce an incredible solo at the end of the film is not due to Fletcher&#39;s tactics. It is despite them. It is down to Andrew&#39;s practice, not to any verbal thrashings he receives. You could argue Fletcher&#39;s insults push Andrew further, but it&#39;s not worth the mental strain on others. It&#39;s clear Fletcher sees the other students that he doesn&#39;t deem to be geniuses as disposable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, Andrew and Fletcher see art as a competition. A race to be the very best. In these terms, it&#39;s worth enduring suffering to get the very best art. But this is nonsense. Art is not a race against anyone. You will never get a medal saying yes, congratulations you are the best at arting. It is not something to be won. It&#39;s a deeply personal examination of the self. You shouldn&#39;t strive to be the best in the world, you should strive to be the best you can be. Even if you think you&#39;re the best, it&#39;s all subjective. Andrew falls victim to this delusion as well, thinking that his life is going to be so much better than his families. He believes he can be the best, which means everyone else has to, by definition, be lesser than him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, practice hard at your chosen art form. Try to be the best you can be. But it&#39;s OK to have breaks.[^2] It&#39;s alright to let life happen. It&#39;s even alright, whisper it, to be happy. You can still make good art whilst looking after yourself. You can even make great art. Being an artist should not require burning everything else on the bonfire of your obsession. If your art is causing you to have problems with your mental health, by all means, give it up for a bit. It is not more important than you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s when I make my best stuff: When I&#39;m happy. When I have the time. When I&#39;m in a routine of practice.  chip away at things slowly, improving time after time until I get something I&#39;m happy with. Then I start again, hopefully having learnt something. You may thrive under extreme pressure. But have balance. Make sure it does not consume you because that is just not healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all it&#39;s great moments and subtle examinations of character, &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt; still perpetuates dangerous myths about art that harm more than they heal. That&#39;s why it should be viewed with a certain degree of suspicion. Every time Fletcher says &amp;quot;Not my tempo,&amp;quot;, remember, this isn&#39;t healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: His Oscar is well deserved.
[^2]: Breaks actually help refocus you and make it easier to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

petty expectations, unpredictable and&lt;br&gt;
strange in ways we can&#39;t imagine.&lt;br&gt;
No neon dominance, except in dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&#39;t eat this bread!&amp;quot; he cried,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;There&#39;s too many chemicals!&lt;br&gt;
Too many strange compounds,&lt;br&gt;
far too many unknowns&lt;br&gt;
crawling in the crust&lt;br&gt;
swarming in the dough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Food is all chemicals!&amp;quot; he yelled,&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing is pure! Not even&lt;br&gt;
orange juice- it&#39;s a lie!&lt;br&gt;
Avoid eating altogether!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for human beings,&lt;br&gt;
best to avoid completely.&lt;br&gt;
All filled with bacteria-&lt;br&gt;
walking disease factories!&lt;br&gt;
All continually colliding&lt;br&gt;
and combining in strange&lt;br&gt;
and frightful ways.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Shun the sun!&amp;quot; he screamed.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Radioactive elemental creator!&lt;br&gt;
It&#39;s all too complex.&lt;br&gt;
Wheres the pure elements?&lt;br&gt;
Give me Hydrogen&lt;br&gt;
maybe Helium. No molecules&lt;br&gt;
whatsoever. Give me&lt;br&gt;
the universe seconds after&lt;br&gt;
the big bang, a simple&lt;br&gt;
cloud expanding into&lt;br&gt;
emptiness. Nothing more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under an all-consuming sun&lt;br&gt;
I was melting into a puddle,&lt;br&gt;
ignoring the illusion of structure&lt;br&gt;
and returning to liquid again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muscles and bones became water.&lt;br&gt;
I knew in time I would seep&lt;br&gt;
into the welcoming earth&lt;br&gt;
or else evaporate into a cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to grab my arm&lt;br&gt;
to pinch myself, but useless&lt;br&gt;
fingers flowed into waterfalls,&lt;br&gt;
denying the last escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So panic left me as steam.&lt;br&gt;
As the last of me dissolved&lt;br&gt;
I became calm, like the surface&lt;br&gt;
of a lake on a still day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no truth in speeches&lt;br&gt;

Power is always corrupting&lt;br&gt;
While the mercury rises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no truth in images&lt;br&gt;
No meaning in words&lt;br&gt;
No beauty in concrete&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s your hand I&#39;m holding&lt;br&gt;
And there&#39;s freedom in dreaming&lt;br&gt;
Its your smile I&#39;m seeing&lt;br&gt;
When I&#39;m waking, first thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s truth in our heatbeats&lt;br&gt;
There&#39;s meaning in our breathing&lt;br&gt;
There&#39;s beauty in these silences&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran from malevolent heat,&lt;br&gt;
abandoning hollow skeleton&lt;br&gt;
skyscrapers back to the sands.&lt;br&gt;
Now, occasional car roofs are shiny&lt;br&gt;
islands, hotel lobbies lie half&lt;br&gt;
buried, billboards are bleached&lt;br&gt;
and peeling like burnt skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even here, as far north as we&lt;br&gt;
could get, the air is arid.&lt;br&gt;
Water is a sometimes blessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday soon we will lie down,&lt;br&gt;
transmute our flimsy bodies&lt;br&gt;
into sand. Atoms of ourselves&lt;br&gt;
will circumnavigate the globe&lt;br&gt;
In great dust storms. We will&lt;br&gt;
become diffuse and settle in dunes.&lt;br&gt;
Earth will exhale for millenia,&lt;br&gt;
an unheard release of tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting again slowly,&lt;br&gt;
a few vines starting to appear,&lt;br&gt;
reclaiming our empty buildings.&lt;br&gt;
Nature always plays the long game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mists rolled in from the ocean&lt;br&gt;
quicker than any tidal wave,&lt;br&gt;
shrouding the shore in confusion.&lt;br&gt;
In seconds unaware sunbathers&lt;br&gt;
were swallowed up by cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my mind was submerged.&lt;br&gt;
Neurons eaten by the fog. I was&lt;br&gt;
unable to see my hands&lt;br&gt;
or anything, except a constant&lt;br&gt;
wispy grey. I cannot know how long&lt;br&gt;
I was lost or how deep I sunk,&lt;br&gt;
forgotten by light. Hours or centuries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;until I emerged, lying in bed,&lt;br&gt;
confused by the gentle fingers of&lt;br&gt;

a temporary beauty come to visit.&lt;/p&gt;

my head tumbling&lt;br&gt;
not too high for vertigo&lt;br&gt;
no decision made&lt;br&gt;
falling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;forward into air&lt;br&gt;
Sixty seconds of freefall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;landing on welcome ground&lt;br&gt;
legs made of sponge&lt;br&gt;
shaking in relief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Night always falls&lt;br&gt;
I’m still plummeting&lt;br&gt;
moments rushing past,&lt;br&gt;
cold bright, unknowable&lt;br&gt;
if I ever look down&lt;br&gt;
the same giddiness&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We lost you there momentarily.&lt;br&gt;
You rambled outside the borders&lt;br&gt;
of yourself. There is no map,&lt;br&gt;
no GPS to locate your lost&lt;br&gt;
and wandering thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do we go in those inbetween&lt;br&gt;
times? It was only a minute,&lt;br&gt;
maybe two. One moment at your desk,&lt;br&gt;
the next outside, sitting by a tree.&lt;br&gt;
Where did your mind roam, while your&lt;br&gt;
body navigated the world blind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back from the unknown.&lt;br&gt;
Have a look around, it&#39;s all yours.&lt;br&gt;
Each second created sparkling new.&lt;br&gt;
A discovery hidden in each instant:&lt;br&gt;
Clouds drifting like unmoored boats,&lt;br&gt;
Grass gently rippling like waves,&lt;br&gt;

grab my hand tight and together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we will forget about gravity,&lt;br&gt;

same field but with a stranger.&lt;br&gt;
Where the ice age never ended.&lt;br&gt;
Where I never was and would never be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Garrulous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine, excessively pleasant morning&lt;br&gt;
where Cirrius Unicus clouds were perfectly&lt;br&gt;
placed over an azure sky, the colour of course,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[I’m lost and frightened]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;caused by Rayleigh scattering in the upper atmosphere&lt;br&gt;
first proposed by Lord Rayleigh in the year 1871&lt;br&gt;
AD, and which is similar but not the same as&lt;br&gt;
the Tyndall effect, discovered by John Tyndall&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[like a child without it’s parent]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in 1860 AD, who used a tube of gases to simulate&lt;br&gt;
the sky and discovered the wavelengths scattering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[trapped in a dark forest]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it was under this magnificent edifice I decided to perambulate around the perimeter&lt;br&gt;
of my humble estate, using my feet for locomotion&lt;br&gt;
much in the style of the flanneurs of old&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[utterly alone and abandoned]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to better retain a sense of space and time&lt;br&gt;
a psychogeography if you will, of the family abode,&lt;br&gt;
each place sparking reminiscences of my childhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[A nightmare I can&#39;t wake from]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;that meant I was so lost in reverie I found it&lt;br&gt;
extremely taxing to remain in the present moment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Let me out.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Unwritten&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been sleeping in segments&lt;br&gt;
like an essay you can&#39;t concentrate on&lt;br&gt;
and write in sloppy short paragraphs&lt;br&gt;
before stopping. I was inbetween waking&lt;br&gt;
and dreaming most days, half asleep&lt;br&gt;
in the day, half awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That one night I must have been asleep&lt;br&gt;
although I felt wide awake and wired.&lt;br&gt;
My vision was engulfed in brightness;&lt;br&gt;
beautiful vision of shock and awe,&lt;br&gt;
hideous in its consuming beauty.&lt;br&gt;
I knew, instinctively, like pulling&lt;br&gt;
your hand from the fire, this was&lt;br&gt;
a Being five dimensions removed&lt;br&gt;
from my pathetic flesh and thought,&lt;br&gt;
constructed from the light beyond sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strange movements amongst the beams,&lt;br&gt;
shades and patterns dancing over me,&lt;br&gt;
a language I now cannot comprehend&lt;br&gt;
but at the time I understood as words.&lt;br&gt;
In my fugue state, a poem was dictated,&lt;br&gt;
verses that contained the answers to&lt;br&gt;
every question, the meaning of time&lt;br&gt;
and the rhythms and lines that could&lt;br&gt;
set a universe into joyous motion.&lt;br&gt;
I wept to hear it. I swore I would be&lt;br&gt;
its unworthy terrestrial messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke, for certain this time, lost in&lt;br&gt;
the hours before the world stirred.&lt;br&gt;
Searching for a pen, I already felt the words&lt;br&gt;
pour out of my memory, like sand grains&lt;br&gt;
through an open palm. When I finally&lt;br&gt;
located a chewed biro, my head was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was left shivering and half awake,&lt;br&gt;
unsure of why I was gripping a pen,&lt;br&gt;
unsure of the time or my location&lt;br&gt;
unsure even of who or what I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dawn chorus had erased the divine&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy some healthy food&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Aquatic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the ice caps finally melted,&lt;br&gt;
flooding the globe one hot summer,&lt;br&gt;
consuming many major cities,&lt;br&gt;
We were caught ignorant and unaware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been foretold and predicted&lt;br&gt;
by scientists all over the world&lt;br&gt;
for long, fruitless decades.&lt;br&gt;
We would not listen to their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many millions of mouths opened wide&lt;br&gt;
not understanding the approaching wave&lt;br&gt;
then filled too quickly with water.&lt;br&gt;
They sank into the icy darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those that remained grew gills,&lt;br&gt;
webbed fingers and toes overnight&lt;br&gt;
remembered how to swim at depths.&lt;br&gt;
We began again in submerged streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were only islands left above,&lt;br&gt;
the summits of some mountains&lt;br&gt;
bravely emerging from the brine.&lt;br&gt;
We stayed in the sea with all we knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there is no returning to land,&lt;br&gt;
no wind whispering wisdom to us,&lt;br&gt;
no fields of grass or gentle clouds.&lt;br&gt;
Together, we dream of sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is precious in this early light.&lt;br&gt;
A fox shuffles between discarded kebabs,&lt;br&gt;
with shimmering fur, golden and new.&lt;br&gt;
A high-rise, shining, is a forgotten temple.&lt;br&gt;
Glass shards scattered over the pavement&lt;br&gt;
are countless stars, illuminating the tarmac.&lt;br&gt;
Emerald leaves grow from amber branches&lt;br&gt;
to shine on us both, staggering stragglers,&lt;br&gt;
almost home, with the rarest crystals for eyes.&lt;br&gt;
Overnight, this city was built again out of silver,&lt;br&gt;
just for me and you, my sapphire love.&lt;/p&gt;

lost amongst the static,&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know as we turned back&lt;br&gt;
it grew thick around us,&lt;br&gt;
Speech swallowed into silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After crossing the vast nothingness,&lt;br&gt;

we crashed into the red dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After scrambling out of the air lock,&lt;br&gt;
still protected from the dubious air,&lt;br&gt;
each in our own plastic cocoon,&lt;br&gt;
we crept along the hostile surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting up our insignificant camp,&lt;br&gt;
the awe set in. We were the first&lt;br&gt;
to cross the darkness, to stand&lt;br&gt;
on a different planet and see the same sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After conducting initial experiments,&lt;br&gt;
we walked the perimeter of the crater&lt;br&gt;
until we stumbled on a human skull,&lt;br&gt;
quite fossilised, buried among the red rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

What did you expect?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also sorry for pouring gallons of oil,&lt;br&gt;

transforming the water into poison.&lt;br&gt;
But, really, the fish were too stupid&lt;br&gt;

cameras, motion sensors, microphones&lt;br&gt;
thermal imagers, informants and secret police.&lt;br&gt;
to watch your every move from the morning&lt;br&gt;
to when your close your eyes, ‘alone’ in bed.&lt;br&gt;
But really if you had nothing to hide&lt;br&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m doing this again. Last year I quite enjoyed the process of creating a brand new poem every day in April so have decided to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s my rules for this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;  
    &lt;li&gt;Use a generator to get a random word.&lt;/li&gt;  
    &lt;li&gt;Write the poem, using the random word as a title.&lt;/li&gt;  
    &lt;li&gt;Post it here and on social media.&lt;/li&gt;  
&lt;/ol&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Last year I didn&#39;t post all the poems I wrote. This year I&#39;m going all in. It&#39;s going to be interesting as one day isn&#39;t much time to edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Habitat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have hibernated in woollen throws&lt;br&gt;
Slept for months wrapped in frayed&lt;br&gt;
dressing gowns, underneath so many&lt;br&gt;
King size thirteen tog duvets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shuttered the vertical blinds&lt;br&gt;
And let winter proceed without us.&lt;br&gt;
We retreated from the iced world&lt;br&gt;
And the continual cover of grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, soft light knocks on the door,&lt;br&gt;
Invites us outside once again.&lt;br&gt;
We peel off our blanket skins&lt;br&gt;
And emerge into the spring sun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shivering and shaking new,&lt;br&gt;
We see a world creating blooms.&lt;br&gt;
A world learning to be itself again,&lt;br&gt;
Ready and waiting to be explored&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creative Anxieties: Fear of not writing enough</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-03-25-not-writing-enough/" />
    <updated>2018-03-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-03-25-not-writing-enough/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;This blog post is late. I was meant to write it last week, but life got it the way, as it always seems to do. It&#39;s not just this week&#39;s though; the self-imposed schedule I imposed at the start of the year has slowly slipped away. This, inevitably, leads to guilt and worry. More specifically, I always feel like I&#39;m not writing enough. I need to produce more. When I do write, it never feels like enough.&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not just me though. Have a look at this thread from Rebecca Williams about the constant guilt and pressure she feels to continue writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to get something off my chest about writing (a short thread). I constantly feel guilty for not writing. I have a lot of demands on my time + exhausted 99% of the time. but then i think, well, others manage, am I just making excuses? but right now...&lt;br&gt;
— rebecca &#39;stay gold pony boy&#39; williams @stupidgirl45 &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/stupidgirl45/status/972534813331730432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;, March 10, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend clicking through as there is a lot of good replies and advice to her in the thread below. Similarly, this post shows these feelings are pretty much universal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You guys, I wrote this in my journal when I was fourteen, and I feel so seen. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/writing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#writing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/79yB08EkUC&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/79yB08EkUC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
— Greg Pak (@gregpak) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/gregpak/status/976565124793294856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading both of these threads, was helpful to me. I identified the same guilt I feel about not writing and it helped hearing others talk about the same feelings. So I thought I&#39;d write my own experiences and what helped me, in the hope it might help others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worry is a vicious circle. Not writing leads to guilt which makes it harder to start which leads to more guilt. I think the problem is exasperated by our old friend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/step-away-from-the-internet/&quot;&gt;the internet&lt;/a&gt;. We see the super successful writers constantly producing amazing articles and we wonder why we can&#39;t do the same. On the internet generally, the new is favoured over the old, so there is a constant desire to engage followers with new content. Marketing advice says you should post every day. Writing advice says you should write every single day without fail. I&#39;ve advocated for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/the-importance-of-a-creative-routine/&quot;&gt;benefits of a creative routine&lt;/a&gt; myself, but it can be overwhelming, especially when you have lots of other things going on in your life at the same time.[^1] This constant pressure to produce can make it feel like you aren&#39;t doing enough and leads to feelings of inadequacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what should you do to escape the pit of malaise? I have very little idea, but here&#39;s what&#39;s worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Forgive yourself.&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;div&gt;It&#39;s easy to say and harder to do. You need to start by not being so hard on yourself. When I wasn&#39;t writing last year, I got some excellent advice along these lines by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.selcouthstation.com/&quot;&gt;Selcouth Station&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m terrible at pressuring myself too. Write when you are able, right now find a way that will help later. Be a detail collector :D  — Selcouth Station Press (@SelcouthStation) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SelcouthStation/status/889523673316700161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;July 24, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this advice very useful. Pressuring yourself into writing and then feeling guilty when you don&#39;t isn&#39;t a healthy cycle. Essentially, you need to forgive yourself. Maybe there&#39;s lots of stress in your life at the moment and writing understandably takes a back seat. Maybe you&#39;ve lost the spark that made it interesting. Maybe there&#39;s simply not enough hours in the day. Whatever it is, there&#39;s probably a reason you&#39;re not writing much. Try to focus on your own process and what works for you. Which means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Ignore others&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Even me if you like. Those people who consistently write great articles every day of the week and have a massive audience? Their world is probably completely different to yours. Maybe they don&#39;t work full time because they won the lottery. Their success is an outlier, but we assume it&#39;s the norm. It&#39;s also important to remember that everyone&#39;s process is different as well. They might &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/making-go-twin-peaks-welcome-nightvale/&quot;&gt;make it up as they go&lt;/a&gt;, while you plan everything out in a detailed way, which takes longer. They might get up at 4 am when you try it you&#39;re a bleary-eyed mess who can&#39;t string a sentence together The point is that you shouldn&#39;t measure yourself against others because their lives, their work, their routine and their measures of success is entirely different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, shift your attention and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Focus on the work.&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You just have to be a little bit selfish, block the outside world and try to make the work as good as possible. Listen to yourself and just focus on getting the words in as good an order as possible. When you&#39;re working on something, it involves blocking out the outside world as much as possible and only being guided by yourself. You might not be as proficient as others. It might take you years to write books. That&#39;s ok, as long as you&#39;re making progress. You have to do it at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem we have with ideas in our society is that they need to be instant. We need to continually react to the world around us, provide instant reactions and instant wisdom. This doesn&#39;t necessarily mean all that content is good. Most of it will be rubbish. Ideas aren&#39;t necessarily instant. Sure, you may get a great idea in the shower and then write it down in a mad frenzy. Or they make take longer to ferment. I&#39;ve got half-scrawled notes in notebooks from ten years ago that I&#39;m only just getting round to making sense of. Stories take longer to write than you might expect. As long as you keep moving forward, it doesn&#39;t matter if you go at the speed of sound or at the speed of growing grass. It&#39;s still moving forward. You have to try and make the work a little better each time. Guilt won&#39;t help that. Similarly, if you need a break from a piece of work, then put it aside and work on something else. Or take a break entirely and go live your life for a bit. It doesn&#39;t make you any less of a writer. It makes you human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s what I think anyway. You need to focus on yourself and ignore the outside world. It&#39;s more important in my opinion to make good work rather than lots of it. In the end, you are probably your own worst critic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I&#39;d modify that advice now, to say it doesn&#39;t have to be every day, just whatever works best for you, as long as it&#39;s regular.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>30 things I don&#39;t know at 30</title>

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-02-28-30-things-i-dont-know/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a certain kind of article you stumble across now and then which consists of important things people have learnt about life. Usually these are linked to a milestone age, like 50, or 10,000 days on Earth. Lists of advice that seems wise and sage and the accumulation of years of study. This is not one of those articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I just turned 30, but I remain staggeringly ignorant of many things. So in no particular order, here are thirty things I don&#39;t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to speak any other language than English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where I left my keys, every single morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calculus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What secret messages the wind whispers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to enjoy eggs.[^1]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do about all the damn Nazis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to bounce out of bed at five am every morning, do yoga, meditate, drink a flax-seed and beetroot smoothie, make a perfect breakfast from scratch before coming up with seventeen brilliant ideas to change the world before most people have their breakfast. I just want to stay in bed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How come I actually got up at 6 am for a year or so when I was writing my first book but then one day I physically couldn&#39;t do it anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How exactly the screaming vortex of insanity that is the stock market actually works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why I find productivity articles so addictive, even though they contain no useful information, won&#39;t change my life and the time spent reading them could actually be used to actually be productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What the song of the spheres sounds like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why music is so effective at being a time machine, instantly transporting you back to specific moments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I meant by notes I wrote days ago, like &amp;quot;The sky is a low ceiling&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;They could do, but they don&#39;t&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Simulation of movement??&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to drive. [^2]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where the best places to go are in this strange new city I find myself in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make friends in this strange new city I find myself in.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Making it up as you go: Twin Peaks and Welcome to Nightvale</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-02-08-making-go-twin-peaks-welcome-nightvale/" />
    <updated>2018-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-02-08-making-go-twin-peaks-welcome-nightvale/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a highly enjoyable few months last year watching &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, both the original seasons and the revival. Even now, twenty-seven years after the original series debuted, it remains a strange mix of police procedural and occult mysticism. The revival plunges even further into the mysticism and dream elements of the show. It’s not always entirely clear what the story is, but as an experience it is incomparable. Many parts of the show work on a dream logic, with images and moments that only seem to make sense in a subconscious way. The last episode, in particular, is terrifying, even though I could not fully articulate why.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a rich mysterious show has created all number of fan theories. It feels like every detail of this incredible world must have been planned out ages ago, that Mark Frost and David Lynch knew where it was going all along. For example, Laura Palmer says in the last episode of the second season “I’ll see you again in twenty-five years”. Twenty-six years later, we have the new series, which opens with that same scene, only now with the actors older. What else could it be other than a master plan, made years ago and only now coming to fruition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the killer in the original series is revealed to be BOB, a destructive, dangerous spirit that inhabits the body of his victims and forces them to engage in horrific acts. It echoes out across the early series and is a key part of the revival. This mythology is revealed slowly, drip by drip. Again, the temptation is to think that Lynch and Frost planned this all out. Actually, the all-consuming spirit was a complete accident. The whole character of BOB was only created when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/twin-peaks/feature/a831806/twin-peaks-killer-bob-origin/&quot;&gt;a set-dresser got into shot accidentally&lt;/a&gt;. Lynch liked it, then wove it into the fabric of the story, creating a mythology to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brilliant finale as well, linking it to the series twenty-six years later? That was mostly&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/10/twin-peaks-final-scene-anniversary-showtime&quot;&gt; just Lynch improvising&lt;/a&gt;, throwing out most of the script and shooting scenes on the fly. That twenty-five years line was probably meaningless at the time, but the writers found a way to incorporate it into the mythology of the show once it was revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this fits with the popular view of creativity. We insist that writers have all the answers of the worlds they create. That they have a grand master plan that is slowly revealed to the audience. Sometimes though, writers just made up as they go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels similar to the progression of one of my favourite podcasts, &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt;. It is another strange small town in the heartland of the United States. Like &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, it has a strange mythology that reveals itself slowly, with odd inhabitants and powerful, otherworldly forces. But it has quite a different tone to &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;, funnier and kinder, and by being confined to a radio station it has a different emphasis. It too was developed serially, week after week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength of both series is their ability to develop threads from small details. Characters take on larger roles and storylines get pulled from small mentions. It&#39;s an exploratory way of writing. You start with the broadest strokes of an idea, but not all of the details. You have an idea where the story is going but it’s not set in stone. By paying close attention to the details as you write, the story goes in a different direction to what you expect. Lynch&#39;s inclusion of a set dresser changed the whole direction of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt; moves from more Lovecraftian horror to a focus on social issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both cases, it works. Neither is quite like anything else. &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; draws uncanny moments from the ordinary and &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt; has an intimacy that allows for warmth in the midst of uncertainty. But both remember their origins and draw on all the details from previous episodes to inform the new, with old characters recurring even as new storylines come along. A major plot point in the revival of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; is based on a throwaway line in unused footage from the film,* Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me*.* Welcome to Night Vale* develops Carlos, the scientist, until he is a main character and love interest. By paying close attention to the previous detail, each series creates its own universe and own rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this all brings to mind George R.R. Martin&#39;s famous &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/749309-i-think-there-are-two-types-of-writers-the-architects&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; about the two types of writers, which is worth putting in full here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they&#39;re going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there&#39;s going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don&#39;t know how many branches it&#39;s going to have, they find out as it grows.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, in my writing, I feel more like a gardener. Often, I start writing to find out where the story is going. I&#39;m a reader and a writer at the same time, caught in the rush of finding out what happens next. [^1] Similarly, I feel both &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt; work in the same way, with writers planting seeds and seeing how they grow. Perhaps the serial format is more open to this way of writing. The work is mutable week by week and can work with accidents instead of against them. It changes over time as each week shifts the story in a different direction. &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt; work so well because they keep an eye on previous episodes and develop the new ones from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these approaches to writing is valid and each story is different. Some stories might be intricately plotted and take a lot of planning. Other stories might develop easily like a dream. There&#39;s always a middle ground as well, having an overarching plan while being open to ideas on the way. I don’t think it’s a simple binary, but I do think it is worth bearing the two approaches in mind when thinking about the creation of art. Sometimes the most stunning of plot twists may not be planned out in advance. If you&#39;re stuck when planning a project, it might just be worth starting to write it and see where you go. The smallest accidents could take you in different directions. Ralph Steadman once said, &amp;quot;There are no accidents in art, only opportunities.&amp;quot; [^2] &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Night Vale&lt;/em&gt; are successful examples of art developing out of accidents and the smallest details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: It’s probably one of the reasons I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;blackout poetry&lt;/a&gt; so much. You start with a word or a phrase and then you are dependent on the whims of the page to guide the poem.

    <title>Advice to Myself: Writing and Resolutions</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-01-24-advice-writing-resolutions/" />
    <updated>2018-01-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2018-01-24-advice-writing-resolutions/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At the start of the year, we tend to set goals and resolutions. This year is going to be the year I start eating healthy, the year I finally learn guitar or the year I start running. Then, inevitably, around this time every year, most of the resolutions are discarded or broken. Maybe they never even started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m by no means immune to this. I tell myself I&#39;m going to Do Things Better. I might even do the thing for a week or two. But by the third week in, its often forgotten about until I decide to Do Things Better months later. That&#39;s the downside of habits, it can be easy to fall out of them as it can to fall into them. That&#39;s why I&#39;m writing this blog post, mostly to remind myself of the power of habits.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the problem is that for most people, life gets in the way. Maybe you start to run. Maybe you even do it for a couple of weeks. Then one day there is torrential rain and you say to yourself, maybe tomorrow. Then tomorrow rolls around and you&#39;re tired from work and you don&#39;t want to go. Then the next day is Friday and you&#39;ve had a hard week and before you know it you&#39;re out of the habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem is that it&#39;s easy to focus on the end goal, but not so much the day to day aspect of any resolution. We focus on being a person who is fit, rather than a person who goes out to run in the torrential rain. Before I started being strict with myself, I wanted to be the person who had written lots of books, not someone who wrote every day. The focus is always on the destination, not the journey. Which is a shame because the journey is a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to hear this, I am writing to remind myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big resolution for many people this year, including myself, is to get back to a creative routine.  Last year was terrible in so many ways. It&#39;s hard to find the time to write when the world&#39;s on fire. Even though I have always believed in the power of a good &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/the-importance-of-a-creative-routine/&quot;&gt;creative routine,&lt;/a&gt; I got seriously blown off course last year. I didn&#39;t heed my advice. I moved across country and changed my life and writing was just not part of that time.  I went back to only really writing when the time was optimal and even then, not always. My writing became scattershot. Every time I sat down to write it was harder because I did not have that regular connection any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An issue with habits is fitting them around your life. I don&#39;t have the luxury of writing full-time. Most people don&#39;t. I have to fit it around work, exercise, going out and endless other distractions. I used to get up at half six every morning, crank out 500 words then get on with the rest of my day. It&#39;s how I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/amberstars/&quot;&gt;my first book.&lt;/a&gt; This routine worked really well for me until suddenly, it didn&#39;t. I was exhausted all the time. I struggled to get out of bed and I couldn&#39;t focus on the words. So I gave it up. Since then, I&#39;ve been floundering, trying to find a new time that works for me. Instead, I should have just focused on writing every day when I could and trust a routine would work itself out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I&#39;ve tried for the last couple of weeks. It seems to be going well, but I might be fooling myself into Doing Things Better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, I&#39;ve found the daily writing is where the magic happens.  If I focus on the finishing line, I can never motivate myself. But writing every day, that&#39;s where the fun is. You can mess around with language and experiment with story. You can feel the words dancing around your fingertips I think it&#39;s better with resolutions to focus on the daily work, every single day. That way you can build something to be proud of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not an original idea. I&#39;ve been reading Neil Gaiman&#39;s collection of non-fiction, &lt;em&gt;The View From The Cheap Seats&lt;/em&gt;.[^1] He writes this about Terry Pratchett:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote four hundred words a night every night: it was the only way for him to keep a real job and still write books. One night, a year later, he finished a novel, with a hundred words still to go, so he put a piece of paper into his typewriter, and wrote a hundred words of the next novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the real key to resolutions, to realise they take time. You have to focus on the daily targets, not the larger ones. Because 400 words a day sounds easy. It&#39;s about one typewritten page of A4. But enough of those build up. Then suddenly, you have a book. It&#39;s the same with being fit. If you set out to run a marathon immediately you&#39;ll probably fail. But if you focus on running or moving daily, you&#39;ll suddenly find yourself fitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s also important to not let the momentum run the other way as well. Failures accrete in much the same way success does. I beat myself up for not having written one day, so I put more pressure on myself the next day. Which leads to another day not writing. So it continues. I happened to read Jordan Aspen&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://jordanelisheva.com/blog/writing-habit&quot;&gt;blog this week,&lt;/a&gt; which helped guide my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than halfway through January I haven’t actually written every day. My little one’s imminent birth is distracting to say the least, and makes it quite difficult to focus on my business, but I’m choosing not to let a skipped yesterday be an excuse not to write today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to stick to a resolution then is to ignore the big picture. Focus on the here and now and don&#39;t beat yourself up too much if you slip. Tomorrow is another day. Don&#39;t just make a resolution in January but monitor it throughout the year, doing a bit at a time to make something big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the coming year, I look forward to ignoring most of this advice.&lt;br&gt;

    <title>Best of 2017</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-12-26-best-of-2017/" />
    <updated>2017-12-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-12-26-best-of-2017/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Much like I did last year, I thought I&#39;d take some time to linger on what I enjoyed this year. I&#39;ve already written up my thoughts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/&quot;&gt;the terrible events in politics&lt;/a&gt;. This will be much more positive.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had high-minded ideals at the start of this year, hoping to linger more on larger books. It didn&#39;t quite work out like that. I read a couple of longer books this year, most notably Alan Moore&#39;s epic &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;, but generally I haven&#39;t found the time to read more in-depth. I have however, been sharing the articles and things I&#39;ve enjoyed more through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinyletter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;my newsletter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of writing, I haven&#39;t done as much as I would have liked either. The follow-up short story collection hasn&#39;t materialised. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/i-learned-break/&quot;&gt;made a massive life change&lt;/a&gt; this year, leaving my job and moving to a new city, so a lot of time has been taken up by that. I&#39;m hoping to do better next year, in terms of reading and writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, onwards onto the best stuff of the year. Let&#39;s start with books, because books are great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Non-Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I had thought I hadn&#39;t read much non fiction this year, but a quick look at my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15112819.David_Ralph_Lewis&quot;&gt;GoodReads&lt;/a&gt; list proves that I was wrong. The non-fiction book that has been essential to my thinking this year was Rebecca Solnit&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/hope-in-the-dark-is-more-relevant-than-ever/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hope in the Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. How could it not be? With the world falling apart outside, I need a history of protest more than ever, especially when the current protests don&#39;t have immediate effects. Solnit&#39;s writing is lyrical and wonderful as she masterfully describes the struggles of direct action but also the importance of keeping hope alive. The book is an island of sanity in a world of madness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Good Immigrant&lt;/em&gt;, edited by Nikesh Shulka, which made me realise I need to shut up and listen more. Written by 21 black, Asian and minority ethnic voices it tackles the barely hidden racism lurking in British society.  It feels hugely important right now, especially with the forces of xenophobia and closed-minded nationalism on the rise due to Brexit. Every essay is passionately argued, but I especially liked Salena Godden&#39;s powerful and lyrical essay &lt;em&gt;Shade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Fiction&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt; is like nothing I&#39;ve every read, but I think Phillip Pullman&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Book of Dust&lt;/em&gt; was my favourite story I read this year. Very much the first part of a trilogy, the story is a welcome return to the universe of &lt;em&gt;Northern Lights&lt;/em&gt;. Pullman develops the original world and expands upon it, adding in all manner of strange and supernatural elements. Like the original &lt;em&gt;His Dark Materials&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, this is children&#39;s fiction that does not patronise children and is stronger than most adult fiction. The characters are so well drawn, there is a constant state of danger and the threat of real violence as well as a subtle probing of the mysteries of the multiverse. As it&#39;s a prequel, you sort of know where it is going but the suspense remains high and it still manages to surprise and delight. I can&#39;t wait to read the next installments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also recommended&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Sudden Appearance of Hope&lt;/em&gt; by Claire North. Hope is a woman who vanishes from your memory minutes after she leaves you. North runs with this premise so well, exploring every angle whilst creating a tense, powerful thriller. it works on many levels, as a superhero story, as a comment on our current obsession with &#39;perfection&#39; and as a feminist allegory and an exploration of freedom and slavery.  It&#39;s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best Album&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This year has been a real bumper year for music. From the Flaming Lips&#39; strange heady &lt;em&gt;Oczy Mlody&lt;/em&gt; to Los Campesinos&#39; fun but devastating &lt;em&gt;Sick Scenes&lt;/em&gt; really think we have been spoilt with the range and diversity of good music this year. Like 2016, returning artists only grew stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to pick one album, it would be Public Service Broadcasting&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Every Valley&lt;/em&gt;. Exploring the collapse of the mining industry in Wales, the album remains hopeful and positive even in the face of disaster. It expands Public Service Broadcasting&#39;s sound beyond voice clips and music to include specially recorded  singers and is all the better for it. It&#39;s an album that is rooted in humanity and makes history personal. I&#39;ve listened to it more than any other album this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also Recommended&lt;/strong&gt;; Mogwai&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Every Country&#39;s Sun&lt;/em&gt; and LCD Soundsystem&#39;s &lt;em&gt;American Dream&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Best TV&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t watch a lot of TV. I rambled on about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/distraction-by-design/&quot;&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.  So it seems strange to devote a whole category to it. I will make rare exceptions to explore box-sets and I really wanted to talk about this show as it has been one of my best pop-culture experiences this year. I devoured all of* Twin Peaks*, starting with the original two seasons and then enjoying the immense, beguiling strangeness of &lt;em&gt;Twin Peaks: The Return&lt;/em&gt;. It is a series that both rewards viewers for paying attention whilst also confounding their narrative expectations. I&#39;ve never seen anything quite like it. The series has a refreshing surreality to it, being terrifying in places without you ever really knowing why, whilst also exploring the liminality between worlds. &lt;em&gt;The Return&lt;/em&gt; especially has some of the most striking and disturbing scenes ever put to film. Do I know what it&#39;s all about? Absolutely not, But the experience is so rich and rewarding, so emotionally effecting, that the ride is so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2018&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So here&#39;s where I make some plans for next year which will inevitably be proved wrong. I&#39;d like to read more non-fiction books, alternating between fiction and non fiction if possible. I&#39;d like to share more things I enjoy in my newsletter, whilst hopefully expanding its readership. In terms of writing, I&#39;d like to keep this blog up and hopefully publish that book of short stories. Maybe a poetry book as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will any of this actually happen? Who knows! I&#39;d like it to, but this year has proven more than anything else I am not brilliant at making predictions. It has also shown me that some art just takes time. You can&#39;t rush to the end. There are no shortcuts and sometimes creating a work of art takes a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in the new year!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2017 in Review: Laughing at the Naked Emperor</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-12-12-2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/" />
    <updated>2017-12-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-12-12-2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So the year isn&#39;t technically over yet. There&#39;s still a good couple of weeks for things to go completely south. I&#39;m travelling first thing next year so I thought I&#39;d get my year in review in early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, I feel this has been the year where those in power have revealed their true nature: incompetent, greedy and self-interested. It feels like many more people are waking up to the fact that the power structures do not serve them. There are no excuses left for the behaviour of the ruling representatives. The emperor has no clothes and everyone is laughing at him. Everyone knows he is naked and dangerous. It is a shame that we had to push the situation to the extreme to recognise the inherent problems in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m mostly talking about my home country here and the clusterfuck of stupidity and incompetence that is the current Tory minority government. But it equally applies to the US, where the poorly written 80s low-budget film villain that is Trump somehow lumbers on. If there is one good thing about the Trump presidency, it is that by being so openly terrible he exposes the structures that were there all along. So by being openly racist, he exposes the racist problems that underlay American society to a wider audience. By being a misogynistic abuser he shows the struggles and danger women have been exposed to for years. By tweeting cofefe he exposes the danger of tweeting while falling asleep. Ok, that last one isn&#39;t necessarily important, but the point stands. He&#39;s highlighting the problems of the USA by making them impossible to ignore. No longer can the issues be swept under the carpet because he does not have the veneer of respectability. He is openly hostile and abusive and not even pretending to be anything else. It&#39;s impossible to compliment the Emperor&#39;s clothes when he is dancing naked two feet away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, these problems have been inherent in the system for years. No one has listened to the victims, or discounted them, or tried to silence them. This year the problems became unavoidable. Those in privileged positions could no longer pretend to ignore the voices of women speaking out about abuse for example. They can try, but the voices have become deafening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s the USA. Here though, it&#39;s been a different story. Racism has been highlighted by the ongoing fallout from Brexit. It has become clear there is no reason for leaving the EU other than open racism. We are becoming an insular nation and will be poorer for it, economically and culturally. Like Trump, the extremity of Brexit only serves to highlight the problems that were in our country all along. The xenophobes and racists didn&#39;t just emerge fully formed by the vote in 2016 but they were there all along. It took the ongoing black hole of reason that is Brexit is to bring them out into the daylight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this would be fine if we had decent politicians. Time and time again through this year, the leaders of this country have proven themselves to be utterly incompetent. Instead of acting in the nation&#39;s interest, it is clear they are working for their own end. Even the Queen has offshore taxes. Our Prime Minister has entirely acted in her own self-interest this year. With Trump demanding constant attention like an overgrown toddler, somehow Theresa May managed to grab headlines by being even more incompetent. I&#39;ll give her this: she has somehow clung to power like a boa constrictor clings to a zebra. Beyond that, she has been utterly useless. Look at her hit list this year: Triggering article 50 with no clear plan and no impact studies done, spending ages delaying the negotiations by not agreeing to clear terms the EU set out as well as well as the ultimate sin of giving Micheal Gove another chance. Worst of all though was when she called a snap election to increase her sizeable majority, then acted like a robot throughout the campaign and refused to meet the people she was supposedly going to represent. She went into the election with no clear plan other than naked arrogance. &amp;quot;Vote for me, you idiots&amp;quot; was her basic message. She ended up losing her overall majority. The whole farce of the election was such a stupid, idiotic move showed how terrible a leader she really is. It was so nakedly in her own self-interest that it exposed her and the whole parliament as completely self-serving. It always has been, but as with Trump, it&#39;s really hard to deny now. Everyone is laughing at the Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a problem with all the laughter. The power structures are still there. The emperor may be naked but he is still in control and he can still have you killed. Trump may be the laughing stock of the world but he still has his finger on the nuclear button. He can still use the system to give the rich even more money or to attempt to take healthcare away from millions of poor people. May still clings to power and she is gambling with the whole of the UK future with Brexit. She capitulated last week and made the start of a deal, but it&#39;s taken months of uncertainty and flailing wildly to get to this point. If her government can&#39;t secure a deal then we crash and burn out of the EU. Millions of people will suffer. Those in power will likely get off scot-free because that&#39;s the way the system is set up. Laugh at the farce all you want, but we need to start demanding better. The resist movement in the US has been a great example of keeping the pressure on, saying &lt;em&gt;this is not normal.&lt;/em&gt; In contrast, there&#39;s been almost no public kickback against May since the election and it is sorely needed. Enough of the British repression, enough of pretending thegovernment knows what it is doing. Now that more people are aware of the problems, I hope 2018 brings changes. Because the danger of thinking our leaders are terrible is that we might start to normalise it. We might expect our leaders to be useless, expect them to be racist, sexist thugs. We might stop hoping for better.  That is the most dangerous path. If we do not demand change, we might say in a year, the Emperor has always been naked. It&#39;s just the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flash Fiction: The Problems of Renting</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-11-27-flash-fiction-problems-renting/" />
    <updated>2017-11-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-11-27-flash-fiction-problems-renting/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello? This is Frank. I came in yesterday to pick up the keys for flat 65. OK? I don&#39;t see why you have to look it up on the computer, it was only yesterday. I didn&#39;t speak to one of your colleagues, no, I spoke to you. I remember you. Blonde hair. You were doing your nails. I came by about 3 pm?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&#39;s about the flat. Flat 65. Eagle Court. I just said. Flat 65. That&#39;s it. No, you don&#39;t need the file I just need to- Ok fine, I&#39;ll hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This music is terrible. Come on, haven&#39;t got all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;No sorry, I wasn&#39;t talking to you. I was just annoyed at the hold music. Hove you ever thought of changing it? It&#39;s a bit loud, especially when your phone seems to be so quiet. Yes, that&#39;s better. Yes, thank you. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the problem is I went to move my stuff in today and-.I didn&#39;t have time yesterday, no. Was still sorting it from the old place. Anyway, I got there a bit early, before the removal van to check it over. The inventory had been done yesterday. No, I couldn&#39;t make it for that. No, I know you should go along to these things. Yes, I agree it&#39;s useful. I just couldn&#39;t make it, that&#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I went over there today and the house is crawling with spiders. Yep, spiders. Floor to ceiling. Every surface is covered in them. Billions of them. I&#39;m not exaggerating, no. They&#39;re crawling all over each over, all over the kitchen and the bathroom and everywhere really. Piles of them, all different sizes. Large tarantulas, tiny money spiders.  Everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&#39;s not really acceptable, no. I just don&#39;t know why it wasn&#39;t mentioned in the inventory. No, it&#39;s not. I&#39;m looking at it now. I found it on the counter, under a pile of baby spiders. It lists all the kitchen stuff. Says it&#39;s in good nick. Says the bathroom is in need of a clean and the wardrobe doors in the bedroom are worn. Say absolutely nothing about an infestation of spiders covering every visible surface. No, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I&#39;m not too happy with this, to be honest. I mean, would you be? I haven&#39;t been able to move my stuff in. I&#39;ve moved out of the old place so I&#39;m sort of in limbo at the moment. No, I can&#39;t just move my stuff in. Because it would get covered in spiders instantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&#39;ll hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloody stupid music again. Arg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello? What? No, I will not accept them as a bonus. It&#39;s not an added extra, is it? You never book a hotel room and they say &#39;Did you want thousands of arachnids over your pillow. Arachnids. Yes. It&#39;s the Latin name for spiders. I don&#39;t know, it just sounds better sometimes. No, I am not getting annoyed. Yes, I will try to calm down. But you have to understand I&#39;m a bit wound up because of the thousands if not millions of eight-legged beasts that are currently squatting in my flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look, can you just send someone round to look at it? I&#39;m not happy. Where am I going to live? No, I can&#39;t live in this place. Because of the spiders. Yes. I keep mentioning them because I&#39;m really annoyed about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send someone round to look. I know they came round yesterday but clearly, it&#39;s happened in between. No, I won&#39;t wait a week. Because I&#39;ve got nowhere to live. Because this place is full of spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I speak to your manager? Oh. Are you? Well, why do you not care about the safety of your tenants? Do you get this all the time, houses infested from floor to ceiling? You seem remarkably blasé about this. No, blasé. It&#39;s French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEND SOMEONE ROUND. MY HOUSE IS FULL OF SPIDERS. I don&#39;t know how else to say it for God&#39;s sake you half-brained, feeble-minded-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to lose my temper. I understand it&#39;s a stressful job. I know you don&#39;t need people like me making it- I know. I apologise. I&#39;m sorry, ok. I shouldn&#39;t have shouted. Hey, don&#39;t cry. I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just a little frustrated. Because my house is crawling with spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will? Brilliant. Oh. Can they not come out sooner? I mean, where am I going to sleep? I&#39;ve only hired the van for today. Because I thought I was going to move in. Because That was the date we agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, don&#39;t cry again. I didn&#39;t even get that annoyed. Yes, I know my tone was cruel. I apologise. I&#39;ll try to moderate it in future. Yes. No thank you, you&#39;ve been a great help. So Friday, 6 pm? I can wait for the man to come round. I&#39;ll get a hotel or something I guess. Put the boxes in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks. You&#39;ve been a great help. No, I&#39;m not just saying that. I&#39;m not. Go get a cup of tea and relax. Oh really? Maybe not then. Don&#39;t want to risk a reaction. Maybe just put your feet up. Ok. Many thanks. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloody stupid fucking idiots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean you. I thought I hung up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What I learned on my break</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-11-13-i-learned-break/" />
    <updated>2017-11-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-11-13-i-learned-break/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a while, hasn&#39;t it? How are you? Are you still doing that thing with them and everything else? Oh really? Good to hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put this blog on a hiatus in the middle of July, which seems like a lifetime ago. A lot has happened in the world and in my life in the meantime. I said I would be back &#39;soonish&#39; but didn&#39;t expect it to be almost four months. A third of a year vanished, just like that. Although, if you look at it from another perspective, four months is a tiny blink in the vastness of eternity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s whats going on with me: I quit my job and my flat in Staines where I had lived for seven years. Reasons for this were varied, but mostly because I wanted my life to go in a new direction for a bit. Together with my girlfriend, we gave everything up and moved in with my parents. Then within the next month, we both got jobs in Bristol and moved into a new flat. The furniture we had so casually discarded in Staines felt necessary and we rebuilt our lives from the ground up. There was a whole lot of other things going on that I won&#39;t go into but basically the last few months have been a rapid series of extreme changes to my whole life. Mostly for my sanity, I thought I&#39;d write down what I&#39;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Change is good but also really scary&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I was stagnating in Staines. I wasn&#39;t developing as a person, just punching the clock and watching the days slip by. I needed to make a big change or I&#39;d just be running on the spot for a few years more. So quitting everything and moving to another city was absolutely the right thing to do. It&#39;s revitalized my interest in so many things and I&#39;m glad I took the risk. But it&#39;s also terrifying. Between me and my girlfriend, we saved up a decent chunk of money before we moved and I still didn&#39;t think it was enough. The whole experience was akin to jumping off a cliff with no idea what lies below. We just had to do it, but for a long month or two, it was incredibly stressful. Were we going to get jobs? What were our future lives going to look like? We had no idea. So there was a lot of unknowns to deal with and a reasonably long period of flux. I&#39;m only just settling into my new life and into my new routine. I&#39;m looking around thinking &#39;Did I just do that?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You have to be lucky to be able to follow your dreams&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;For all the instability, we were in a very privileged position in the last few months. We had enough savings to move. We had my parents who had space and were happy to put us up. We found jobs relatively quickly. I was aware while we were making this change that we were very lucky. All the Pinterest inspiration blogs always say &lt;em&gt;reach for the stars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;follow your dreams&lt;/em&gt;, but they never consider the practicalities.There&#39;s always external consequences and it&#39;s never as simple as just following your dream. To be able to take a leap in the dark is a privilege in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Creativity needs stability&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot more spare time for a couple of months because I wasn&#39;t working. This is prime writing time, long hours stretching out into the future. Whole days that can be spent at a desk, pen in hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I didn&#39;t really write anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was too much going on, too much stress and pressure that writing seemed to be an unnecessary pressure that I just couldn&#39;t do. Personally, I think my creativity thrives on constraints and routine. When I can write all the time, I end up writing nothing. Much better to have a regular hour or two to myself around a working week so I can focus on the writing in a concentrated amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&#39;t beat yourself up&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, I felt a constant pressure to write more. To always be producing. I think it&#39;s something a lot of creative people struggle with. However much you write or create it&#39;s never enough. And if you&#39;re not producing anything it feels like the pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to forgive yourself. I can&#39;t write in the chaos, so I had to just try to tell myself I would write when I was ready. It made me realize how much of my creative work generated worries and self-made pressure.  You have to let it go because it&#39;s not going to be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future of the blog&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;So what now? I&#39;m back in a writing routine. The works in progress are coming along. I&#39;m working on a book of poetry which combines my backouts with poems and also a book of sci-fi short stories. I&#39;m going to keep updating this blog, probably every two weeks instead of every one. One week I&#39;ll write this blog, the other week I&#39;ll send out &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;a newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. This will hopefully give me time and space to really make this blog the best I can as well as time to work on the works in progress. The topics are still going to be scattershot. I had considered just making this about writing or about poetry, but I don&#39;t want to limit myself to just one topic. I&#39;d probably get more hits if I focused it, but I want it to be honest to my interests, which are all over the place. So expect some more flash fiction, some ranting about politics and some general ramblings about life and art and that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stick around. I&#39;m still figuring this out, but it&#39;s going to be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taking a Break</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-07-20-taking-a-break/" />
    <updated>2017-07-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-07-20-taking-a-break/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m currently in the business of moving across the country. I&#39;m packing up my whole life into boxes. Every time I move I forget how all consuming and stressful it is. Foolishly, I thought I could carry on writing this blog whilst I was moving. Clearly, I was wrong. I&#39;ve had no time to write at all. Life has got in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&#39;m taking a break from this blog for a bit. I need to focus on moving and then finding a job. It will have to go on the back burner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve also made very little progress on my next books. Words per day have slowed to a trickle. So I need to focus on them if I am going to make any progress whatsoever. This isn&#39;t just a short term thing but has been evident in the last few months. I&#39;m a little burnt out with all my writing projects at the moment, so that&#39;s another reason to put this blog on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I got serious about writing, three years or so ago, I&#39;ve felt a constant pressure to produce more. I want the works in progress to be done now. I want to constantly be producing new books and material. The problem with this way of thinking is that it becomes exhausting after a while. Other people may be able to keep it up but I need to take a break for a bit and reset my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will still be sending out &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyletter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;my newsletter &lt;/a&gt;and posting blackout poems on&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis/&quot;&gt; Instagram&lt;/a&gt; in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be back here soonish, but for now I&#39;m pressing pause.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There is No Exit: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-07-14-there-is-no-exit/" />
    <updated>2017-07-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-07-14-there-is-no-exit/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A quick flash fiction written from a prompt from Chuck Wendig once again. This time, the prompt was &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/07/07/flash-fiction-challenge-there-is-no-exit/&quot;&gt;There is no exit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivor trudged home. It had been a long, hard day. He had got into the office at 7 in the morning and it was past 10 at night now. The office was struggling to complete the audit and he had to pitch in. Still, it was better than previous years, back in The Agency. His thoughts started to drift back to- No. He was stronger than that.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking down the street, he was almost home again. Small flat in one of the outer boroughs. Way, way too much money for what you got but at least it was his. Most of the other employees of The Agency moved out of the country. He was one of the few who remained. He should have gone elsewhere, but why? There was nowhere he wanted to go. Besides, this city was home. It&#39;s labyrinthine streets filled with dead ends was the only place he ever felt comfortable. Despite The Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop thinking about it, Ivor told himself. You&#39;re tired. It&#39;s not helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he arrived at his flat door, he knew something was wrong instantly. There was a deep scratch by the lock. Ivor knew, before he even pushed the door, that it would swing open. Someone had forced the lock and let themselves in. Was it a burglar? Had all his stuff been stolen? What to do? Run away? Ivor sighed. He was so tired.  It had been such a long day. Resigning himself to whatever lay beyond, he opened the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Darkness. Of course. In the gloom, a figure. Sat on his armchair. Waiting. Waiting for him.  Of course. That&#39;s how they operated. It was worse than a burglar. Much worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivor flicked the light on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was only half surprised to see Janice sat there, with her same smug grin he remembered from all those years ago. Same way of looking down at you as well. She had aged, of course, but everyone had. Janice had held up pretty well. Only a few more wrinkles, but that same hard jaw and cold eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I was wondering when you would join me,&#39; she said, with a smirk. Of course she was enjoying it. Ivor put his bag down and crossed to his drink cabinet. There was a glass missing. Janice had clearly taken advantage of his absence. Oh well. He poured himself a large glass of brandy and drunk half of it. It burned and he felt sick. He needed it though. The jolt of the alcohol shook off some of his weariness and brought him back to the room. He turned to face his visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;What do you want Janice? I&#39;m done. I left a long time ago.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice picked up her own glass and spun the ice around. She always loved a bit of theatrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Got another job for you. Nice complicated one.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Did you not just hear me?&#39; Ivor said, his voice tired and weary. &#39;I&#39;m out. I finished with The Agency a long time ago.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He turned away from her, trying to hide the glass shaking in his hand. The memories had laid sleeping for so long were now awake and hammering at the door of his conciousness, waiting to get in. She&#39;ll have a gun, he thought to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Shame.&#39; Janice was smiling to herself again. She knew something he didn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Leave me alone.&#39; Ivor was so tired. He just wanted to crawl into bed and stay there. He didn&#39;t need this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;You never leave the Agency, Ivor. You know that as well as I do. There is no exit clause in your contract.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, he met her gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I retired.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From under a cushion, Janice produced a small pistol. Yep. Right on cue. Ivor knew the tactics and knew where all this nonsense was going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Come now Ivor. For old friend&#39;s sake.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memories were a flood now. They tumbled through his mind in disjointed, confusing parts. Images and sounds he had forgotten. Moments where the choice had been the wrong thing or something worse. Piles of standard forms to be completed. A collection of sterile, anonymous rooms. Late night flights to some field in some corner of the world. Blindfolds and pliers in the supply closet. He remembered he had a system for getting out blood stains. All this passed before him in a flicker of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sighed. There was no way he was returning to that. He couldn&#39;t run. There would be another member of the agency waiting outside to scoop him up. His flat was on the third floor, so the window was out. Where to go? What to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of turning and running, he walked up to Janice and knelt down. He rested his forehead on the barrel of the gun. It felt comforting. Safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;What are you doing?&#39; Janice&#39;s cool demeanour had been shaken up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I&#39;m not going back.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice smiled again, regaining control once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;That&#39;s what you think.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She held the gun against his forehead, just for a moment. Ivor could feel the weight and the coolness of it.Then, before Ivor could even blink, she aimed down and fired the pistol into his leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was pain. A sudden shock spreading upwards. But it was not as much as he thought. Ivor looked down. A red feathered dart was sticking out of his thigh. He tried to focus on it, but the world was fading around him. Everything was losing detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tried to speak but he mouth didn&#39;t seem to work. &#39;Whaa?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then blessed darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Ivor came round slowly. A blank wall. A sterile fluorescent light above him, flickering slightly worn lino on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He came round a bit more. A windowless room. He was sat on a plastic chair, his hand bound behind him. Through his confused and tired brain, one thought ran clear. The Agency. He closed his eyes and tried to wake up safe in his bed, but it was no use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was back.  They had brought him back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-07-05-glastonbury-festival-thoughts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Posts on this blog have been a bit scarce for the last couple of weeks, mostly because I spent a several days in a field in Somerset. I listened to music, watched comedy and saw the odd &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/24/jeremy-corbyn-calls-for-unity-in-glastonbury-speech&quot;&gt;politician&lt;/a&gt;. [^1] I was lucky enough to attend &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Glastonbury Festival&lt;/a&gt;, a cornucopia of delights that I have gone to since I was fifteen.  This was my seventh time at the festival. I have been to others in the meantime, but it remains the original and the best. It is a marvellous tent town where the outside world is put on hold for a while, where the normal rules no longer apply and where art and hope rules above everything else.  I thought I&#39;d write about why it remains so special to me and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;As a wide-eyed fifteen-year-old, I was amazed that such a place existed. There are hundreds of bands on and thousands of people. all gathered together to celebrate art. The scale of the site is Glastonbury&#39;s real strength (and weakness). It is huge. Across 60 odd stages, there are so many acts on that it is impossible to keep track of them all. The size is staggering. What really blew me away when I was younger was the sheer variety of performances around the site. As well as music, there is poetry, circus, comedy and film. The whole five days are a celebration of art in all its myriad forms. Seeing all those different acts in one place made a significant impact on me. It showed me that what I had considered music and art was really only a very small section of the world. There were so many more people creating and playing and performing than I had ever realised. It was incredibly inspiring to be part of a larger community.  
&lt;p&gt;The community is one of the reasons many people return year after year. Hundreds of thousands of people come together to watch bands together. At it&#39;s best, I found this experience to be profoundly moving. During Elbow&#39;s secret set this year, I found myself weeping as thousands moved together as one, swaying and singing the lyrics together.[^2] You surrender your ego at the gates and become part of something larger than yourself. It is a secular form of worship, abandoning the self into the crowd to be completely engulfed and moved by the music.  I desperately need to get out of my head at the best of times so I find it rejuvenating. As well as this, People are almost universally kind to one another. It&#39;s how society should be. The day I arrived it was the hottest day of the year. I stood in a queue for five hours, then was dehydrated and exhausted once I got into the site. Many people stopped to offer me water or help. The same stories are repeated across the weekend. Kindness and joy rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society has used festivals throughout history as a release valve, to suspend and disrupt the normal rules of life. It&#39;s an escape from the system. Sometimes it&#39;s a feasting day, other times a fool is appointed &lt;a href=&quot;http://theoddmentemporium.tumblr.com/post/38568900358/the-lord-of-misrule-and-the-feast-of-fools-in&quot;&gt;lord of misrule&lt;/a&gt;. The same pattern recurs throughout history. Glastonbury offers the same function, creating an alternate reality just for a few days where the rules of the outside world no longer apply. Because the site is so huge and in the middle of the countryside, it really feels removed from the restrictions of everyday society. You can stop working and celebrate being alive. So people do things they wouldn&#39;t usually, like drinking at breakfast and taking drugs to party through the night four days in a row. But people also dress in massive, elaborate costumes and create even more visual splendour than the site offers. It is not just a one-way exchange, but two-way, where people collaborate to create a huge explosion of art and creativity. The relaxation of normal rules for five or so days allows the real world to be that much more bearable. It&#39;s necessary to escape it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, the reason I love this particular music festival is that it is what you make of it. More than any other, it offers an incredible variety of acts and experiences. Want to stay by the main stage and watch popular acts? Want to stay up all night raving in a replica of a tower block? Or do you just want to spend the weekend watching various circus acts? Go for it. All of these options and more are available to you. You can choose how the festival is going to go for you. The only rule is you can&#39;t see it all. There&#39;s way, way too much on for that. Sometimes I wish I had a time turner so I could go back and see the bands that clashed. But the variety and wealth of experiences is incredible. I think it is a reminder that in real life, away from the music, you chose your own path. Those experiences are out there, you just have to choose them. You largely make your own luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is over thinking what is essentially five days of listening to music in the sunshine. [^3] But I really feel at home in the fields. I&#39;ve been lucky enough to go across thirteen years and more than any other event it has shaped my outlook on music and life. Five days every couple of years has greatly impacted my outlook on life. I was weeping in Elbow not just because of the unity of the crowd, but also because they were one of the first bands I remember playing thirteen years ago. It felt like my life had almost come full circle. Places become special not through any mysticism or magic, but because of people visiting many times, building up stories with them. Glastonbury is a special place for me and I am glad I got to go again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[^1]: I have never seen the main field so full of people as when Jeremy Corbyn gave his speech. Even the biggest band in the world couldn&#39;t hope for that sort of crowd.
[^2]: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/MUOsztgBE-I&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; song set me off and then I was a mess for the rest of their set.
[^3]: Sometimes, maybe, if you&#39;re lucky.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Thief of Moons: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-06-13-thief-moons-flash-fiction/" />
    <updated>2017-06-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-06-13-thief-moons-flash-fiction/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A story written from a prompt by Chuck Wendig at&lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/06/09/flash-fiction-challenge-ten-random-titles/&quot;&gt; Terrible Minds&lt;/a&gt;. This week we had to pick a title, so I chose the Thief of Moons. Enjoy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;My mother had always told me to avoid the thief, but she never went into detail. She only offered vague warnings. Only once, when we were sat by the fire late at night, did she speak more. She had guzzled one too many gins and sat cursing him over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I never used to be this old.&#39; She said. &#39;The years have been stolen from me. I don&#39;t know where they went.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, it was the ramblings of an old woman, bitter at the hand she had been dealt. The lines had crept over all over her face and her spine had curved forward, but this was to be expected for her age. She had me late in life and never forgave herself. Still, I humoured her when she gripped my hand tight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Don&#39;t you ever speak to him, Isobel. He&#39;s got a charming smile, but he&#39;ll take all your moons in a blink of an eye.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just nodded to humour her, ever the obedient daughter. I bit my lip to try and bury my frustration. It was another incomprehensible rule to add to the list. Don&#39;t go out at night, stay in the house as much as possible, always clean up after yourself, never answer back, never be sarcastic etc etc. There were too many to name. It meant I was almost permanently in the wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had always been protective, but since my dad&#39;s death five years ago she had become controlling. I had been pulled out of school to work at home. Leaving the house was forbidden, so I spent my days making bread, tidying up and generally keeping house. My mum worked as a seamstress, making clothes for the village. It didn&#39;t bring much money in. Once, I suggested I should find some work, but my mum would hear none of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;A precious lamb like you Isobel isn&#39;t going anywhere. The thief might find you. Mark my words.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what could I do but bite my tongue and get on with the day to day tasks, dull as they were? I just had to carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One autumn night, I was shivering in my bed, unable to shake thoughts of a new life. I pictured myself running out of the door of the small cottage, down the lane and into the unknown, but the night was cold and I didn&#39;t know where I would go. I glanced around my room for some reason. That&#39;s when I saw him. An outline of a man, tall and handsome. Just standing in the middle of my room as if there was no issue at all. He was silver in the moonlight falling through my window. His eyes sparkled. I gasped and my mouth hung open. I physically couldn&#39;t look away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;It&#39;s rude to stare.&#39; he said, a slight smile creeping round the corner of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t feel like screaming. There was no panic. I was mesmerised. I had never seen anyone so beautiful. The sheet had fallen from me and I realised I was only in my slip, and this man could see me almost naked. I didn&#39;t care, I thought. Let him look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;What...What are you doing in my room?&#39; I managed to stammer out, still staring at the man. He took a step towards me and seemed to shimmer as he moved. His body was made of pure moonlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;You want to escape.&#39; His voice was a stream gently babbling, taking all worries and cares with it&#39;s current. His words caressed my ears. There was no point asking how he knew, or why he was here. He spoke the truth. I yearned to leave this small flat and find a new life. I nodded. Of course, I wanted to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I can help you.&#39; Another step closer. He was almost at the bed now, so close I could almost touch him. He didn&#39;t seem to breathe. Instead, he was perfectly still, like the moment between seconds. He half smiled again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wave of certainty spread over me. I knew he was the thief my mother had warned against so many times. He was dangerous and I shrunk back. Just at that moment though, he smiled fully. It was beautiful. The smile was pure light and I was almost blinded. Tears rolled down my cheeks. In that moment, I decided. Whatever the price, I would pay it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Okay.&#39; I said. My voice was swallowed up by the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thief put his hand out to me, perfectly still. I reached out and touched the silver light. His fingers felt cold and insubstantial, like mist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiled. With his other hand, he pointed at the moon through the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long heartbeat, nothing happened at all. Then the moon spun on its axis. It waxed and waned, rising from full moon to nothing in a breath. I never saw anything more beautiful or more terrifying. I felt nausea rising as the moon flickered faster and faster. A sharp tone cut through my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Stop!&#39; I found myself screaming &#39;STOP!&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moon stopped its incessant spinning. The tone cut off abruptly. I turned to the beautiful man. He smiled at me, that stunning smile once again. With that, he evaporated like a fine mist before my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was I dreaming? I was still in the same room as before. Nothing seemed to have changed. I hadn&#39;t escaped. Had it all been for nothing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lifted my hands to the door. They were liver-spotted and knarled. That thief had been here years ago, back when I was a teenager. He had stolen my moons from me and kept them for his own pleasure. I was old now and could never get the years back. I was left withered and broken, cursing the thief of moons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battle of the Ages in the Election</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-06-06-battle-ages-election/" />
    <updated>2017-06-06T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-06-06-battle-ages-election/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So there&#39;s an election on Thursday. You might have heard of it. You probably have your own opinions one way or another. Maybe you don&#39;t care. But either way, you have to admit, it is kind of a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story so far: professional Cruella de Ville impersonator and unconvincing robot Theresa May surprised everyone by calling a snap election in March, mostly to shore up her majority. She ran a campaign on a cult of personality, despite having none. This and her endless slogans repeated like a skipping CD meant she plummeted in the polls. Jeremy Corbyn on the other hand actually fought the election on a human level and became massively more popular than previously expected. Will it translate to a win? Who knows!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;So that&#39;s the story weaved by the media and the polls. But ever since the whole &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/&quot;&gt;Brexit debacle,&lt;/a&gt; I have been wary of the story spun by these fortune tellers. They have been wrong before, there is no reason they cannot be wrong again. They are essentially poking at entrails while gawping into a crystal ball, hoping for a clear prediction. So I take everything they are saying with an ocean full of salt these days.  
&lt;p&gt;I see all my friends support Labour. I support Labour as well. Obviously, this leads me to be optimistic. Great, that&#39;s a Labour win then. Easy. Of course, I am only seeing this because, like everyone, I live in a bubble. So I hope Labour will gain power on Thursday but at the same time, I am cautious because I have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-06-06-battle-ages-election/alternative-facts/&quot;&gt;burnt many times before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One narrative thread this election has been built on is the battle between youth and age. The older generation tends to vote Conservative whereas the younger generation tends to vote for Labour. A huge amount of young people voting on Thursday could see a huge swing towards Labour. (Maybe. Go on). I was wondering why there is such a Grand Canyon division. The media seeks to portray young people as hopelessly idealistic, with little idea of how the real world works, but I reject this idea. As a sort of young person myself I don&#39;t think it fits with the highly intelligent people I see who know how the world works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One explanation for the age divide could be this; young people are more progressive because they are going to be living in a new world and thus can help create it. Whereas the older generation is facing the looming spectre of mortality, so they prefer to regress to their youth, when things were &#39;better&#39;. I think this is fundamentally the difference between left wing politics and right wing politics. The right wing sees the world as broken and yearns to go back to a golden age whereas the left sees the old world as broken and wants to progress towards a better future. Or to put it another way, Conservatives want an ice cream from their youth that had way more cream than the modern stuff, but Labour wants a whole new type of ice cream that hasn&#39;t been invented yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another explanation is this: young people have grown up to be more tolerant and more inclusive than their parents. Whereas the previous generation had to adjust their attitudes to race, gender and sexuality as they went along, the current generation grew up in a world where being decent to one another was already the norm. As such, when bigotry rears one of its hydra heads, young people are more easily able to identify it because it is no longer the existing story. It&#39;s different and scary. It&#39;s a snake in plain sight, rather than in a viper pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely that none of these are true, I&#39;m just trying to outline some potential alternative theories that I don&#39;t think we hear that much in the debate at the moment. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/everything-is-a-story/&quot;&gt;Everything is a story&lt;/a&gt; after all, but some stories dominate the conversation more than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the story I want to believe in. Young people like myself are more progressive not because of age or wide-eyed optimism, but because we can see it makes sense for the country and for the people as a whole. The next generation wants to live in a world where the state supports its citizens, where benefits for disabled people are not taken away, where the NHS remains free and accessible to all. I certainly want to live in a country that is open and inclusive, not closed and suspicious. We want these things not because we will gain from them, but because we reject the dominant narrative that says every person is out for themselves. It is better for a society to remove as many injustices as it can that stand in the way of its citizens because then we can all move forward into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the story the Conservatives are trying to spin. They are trying to pull up the drawbridge, ransack everyone for money so the richer and the poor get poorer. They are trying to go against humanity&#39;s natural instinct and force people to become more insular and more selfish. They are not offering a vision for the future. They barely have a plan for Brexit and that might be a kind of big deal. They are up for whatever they can get. Theresa May just wants more power because power is addictive. She also wants a coat made of one hundred and one dalmatians (not really). It&#39;s a selfish ideology and I hope it is rejected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier I&#39;ve had my fingers burnt in the past. It&#39;s entirely possible I might get them burnt again and again until my fingerprints are gone and I can&#39;t point to anything with my ashen stumps. But I always want to believe in a better world, a new vision of the future. Once you give up on that, you give up on hope and the possibility of change. Then what else is there but to turn inward and vote Tory? So keep that spark alive. If Labour loses this election, keep fighting for a better future. Don&#39;t allow this world to wear you down. This generation is more progressive and inclusive than any other and that is a strength, not a weakness. We need to keep that alive and built a better world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dispatches from the Uncanny Valley</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-31-dispatches-uncanny-valley/" />
    <updated>2017-05-31T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-31-dispatches-uncanny-valley/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/assets/images/articles/robot.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Uncanny valley&quot; class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stood before the seated figure, my stomach turned. Every part of my brain was screaming that the face before me was alien. It looked so lifelike. So much like a human. Then it moved and everything felt wrong. I moved on from the robot to the next exhibit, trying to shake the odd feeling those semi-lifelike eyes had given me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This robot was featured in a fascinating Science Museum exhibition that details the cultural history of robotics. It was the Kodomoroid communication android that weirded me out. The combination almost realistic skin, blank expressions and slight movements gave me physical chills. The feeling I encountered was a strong example of the&lt;a href=&quot;http://theconversation.com/uncanny-valley-why-we-find-human-like-robots-and-dolls-so-creepy-50268&quot;&gt; uncanny valley&lt;/a&gt;. By its nature, it is an uncomfortable feeling. Your instincts are to avoid the almost-human. Yet increasingly we find this feeling in the media we consume. It recurs again and again in computer games, in movies and in all culture around us. We have entered the valley and there is a long climb out of it. The robot I saw at the exhibition was just the latest example of a trend that has reached fever pitch in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2011/06/22/uncanny-valley-la-noire-blade-runner-heavy-rain&quot;&gt;computer games&lt;/a&gt;, we see the same trend repeated. A quest for greater and greater photorealism in graphics has led to a problem where characters don&#39;t feel life-like. It is near impossible to create humans in graphics that are indistinguishable from a video, although that had been the aim for some time. In films as well, CGI characters have overtaken everything, to varying degrees of success. We&#39;re stuck in the valley. The problem is that a fully realistic artificial portrayal of a human is near impossible. There are too many factors to consider: slight movements of the eyes, micro-expressions, blushing and empathetic gestures to name a few. One of the issues the exhibition highlighted was that in creating realistic robots, we need a better understanding of the humans. We need to research our own movements and expressions so we can better relate to the machines we are creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was clear from the exhibition that robotics have a long way to go. We are nowhere near the sentient replicants of &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; that are indistinguishable from humans. Most of the lifelike representations of humans fall solidly into the uncanny valley, giving people the creeps. It is hard to trust something that instinctually feels wrong. They are limited in function and somewhat basic. The advances in future years will likely be in combining several existing technologies, but the uncanny valley is a hard problem to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways around the problem is to simply the design, turn characters into more stylised figures. Some of the robots in the exhibition did this, with exaggerated eyes or simplified expressions. But the quest for perfect human simulation still continues. Why, if the effect is so creepy and unsettling? Perhaps because people want to climb out of the valley and get close to realism as possible. However, I think this desire is fueled by our culture, specifically science fiction. After all, the culture and stories we tell directly influence the technology that is made. Just look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seeker.com/45-years-later-star-trek-continues-to-inspire-1765404736.html&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/a&gt; and how much influence it has on technology and scientists working today. Dreams created in fiction have a direct influence on reality. We are always going to try to vault the uncanny valley because our fiction tells of realistic robots, androids indistinguishable from humans. Of course, we are striving for perfect simulations of humans in our art and in robotics because the idea has been all-pervasive in our culture for hundreds of years, ever since &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;. The culture influences the technology we are creating because the story is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe it&#39;s not just a one-way street, however. Why this all matters is I think it is a feedback loop. The culture influences technology, which influences different culture and so on. So if we&#39;re stuck in the uncanny valley, the overall feeling is going to be one of revulsion. If you are continually repulsed by human representations in the culture and robots that surround you, then it is difficult to feel empathy. Perhaps this lack of empathy spreads to your fellow human beings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the exhibition, I rewatched the film &lt;em&gt;A.I&lt;/em&gt;, which perfectly encapsulates the feelings of horror and disgust we feel when presented with almost humans. In the film, the discarded robot David is taken to a fair when robots are brutally destroyed in horrific ways for a cheering crowd. It shows the lack of empathy and repulsion we feel when presented with alien representations of humans. It also shows the danger of lingering in the valley for too long. The robots are shown as caring, but the crowd cheers as they are ripped apart. Living in the uncanny valley means surrendering empathy. It can conceivably be extended out to other human beings as well if we stay within the uncanny valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a dangerous place to be. We need to create stories that generate empathy to counteract the uncanny valley effect. There won&#39;t be realistic robots for decades yes, nor will there be realistic simulations of humans in games and films for some time. People are going to strive towards realism for longer. We&#39;re stuck in the valley and we need ways of countering it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Debate: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-25-a-debate/" />

    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-25-a-debate/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE NEWSINGTON&lt;/strong&gt;: Welcome back. A new study suggests the moon has a more abundant mineral content than previously realised. Interesting stuff. Joining us to discuss some important questions is the author of the study, Professor Ian Boffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR IAN BOFFIN:&lt;/strong&gt; Good morning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; And on the other side we have the president of Moon Lies dot-com, Shannon Onangononon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON ONANGONONON:&lt;/strong&gt; Good to be here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Good to have you both here. Professor, if I can start with you first, could you explain what exactly you found in this study?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, we ran an analysis of moon rocks and samples brought back from the Apollo missions, using a new form of spectrography. What we found was really very interesting indeed. We now think the moon is much more mineral rich than previously thought, with many precious stones buried beneath the surface. Of course, further research is needed and if we could get more samples-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Indeed. But how do we know the moon is real in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(PROFESSOR IAN BOFFIN is stunned into silence.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m going to have to push you, Professor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR&lt;/strong&gt;: I mean.. It&#39;s there. In the sky. We can observe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting argument. Shannon, would you like to respond to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Thanks Katie. Obviously, Professor Boffin here is part of the international conspiracy that has us all believing there is a giant orb in the sky that magically controls the tides. It&#39;s a ridiculous notion. I mean, if you think about it for just a moment or two, the whole story falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. And what do you think the glowing orb in the sky is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&#39;t really appreciate your tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes Professor, please try to keep the discussion civil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; The object you can see in the night sky is clearly a holographic projection from some point on earth. Maybe China. Or Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Interesting counter theory. Professor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; I think that may be the stupidest sentiment I&#39;ve ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; I am insulted! My opinion is as valid as yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Look, we have been to the moon. That is how I was able to conduct this study, with rocks that astronauts have retrieved from the surface and transported back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;m sorry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Spreading lies about the Apollo landings again. Typical big lunar propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; It&#39;s not propaganda, it&#39;s actual fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; How can we go there when it doesn&#39;t exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Look, this is distracting us from my research which really demonstrates that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Let Shannon speak Professor. You were saying about the Apollo landings. What do you believe?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I think there&#39;s zero evidence that astronauts actually took a rocket to the moon. I mean, the white rock doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s clearly a hologram. NASA knows this, but they were paid off by the government to keep the conspiracy going. So they faked the moon landings of course, in a studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Professor, do you have anything to say to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, this whole debate is ridiculous. It&#39;s a fact that we have been there, it&#39;s fact that the moon exists.  It controls the tides and was likely formed from a large collision with the earth-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Listen to what you are saying. It&#39;s rubbish. You&#39;re being paid off by the space industry, the pro-moon lobbyists. You&#39;re part of the conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Why would the moon need lobbyists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; You&#39;re part of the problem. People like me are providing real answers to the lunar question, whilst you are pushing your pro-moon agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; I have studied cosmology for twenty-six years at Oxford, and have run several studies on the samples from the Apollo missions. I have worked closely with NASA and the ESA. If there was some sort of conspiracy to create a holographic satellite, I would know about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you been to the moon though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; What a ridiculous question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; This is ridiculous, I came on here to talk about my new study. I have never-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Please answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; Have you personally travelled to the moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; No, I haven&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; So how do you know it exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Because all the evidence shows that it exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; I&#39;ve looked at the evidence and concluded it&#39;s a hologram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, that&#39;s just incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Professor, there are two sides to every story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; No, there&#39;s not. Sometimes, there are just facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Well that&#39;s your opinion. Final thoughts Shannon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHANNON:&lt;/strong&gt; The moon is a lie, people! Look at the facts! Follow the money! Decide for yourself! Wake up people, wake up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Professor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROFESSOR:&lt;/strong&gt; I never want to come on this programme again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KATIE:&lt;/strong&gt; Professor Ian Boffin, Shanon Onangononon, Thanks to you both. Coming up next, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/a-press-conference/&quot;&gt;it&#39;s been 127 days&lt;/a&gt; since the Foreign Secretary has been seen in public. Has she got the Symptoms? Or is she fighting in the Shadowlands? We investigate after the break.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oak Tree Manor: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-17-oak-tree-manor/" />
    <updated>2017-05-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-17-oak-tree-manor/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another story from a prompt at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/05/12/flash-fiction-challenge-the-subgenre-smash-and-grab-2/&quot;&gt;Terrible Minds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This week was a mash-up of genres. I got &#39;Haunted House&#39; and &#39;Body Horror&#39;. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;William shifted uneasily in the bed. It was no use. He couldn&#39;t sleep. Every time he was just about to drop off, he was woken by a creaking in the great house. It seemed to be coming from all around him, loud and all-pervasive. The sound filled his ears and jolted him from the edge of much-needed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, it wasn&#39;t going to happen. He sat up in bed, then fumbled for the matches he had left next to the huge oak bed. He couldn&#39;t find them. The dark was making him jumpy. With a sigh of relief, he found the box and lit the candle that was next to his bed. The oppressive darkness was replaced by flickering shadows. William wasn&#39;t sure if this was an improvement or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;His arm was stiff. Had he been lying on it funny? It seemed to have seized up. He bent his elbow slowly, felt it creak like the old wood of this ancient house.  
&lt;p&gt;Why was he here? What was he trying to prove? Oak Tree Manor had been Aunt Edith&#39;s, but he could barely remember her. He had a vague memory of seeing her at some birthday party, maybe his, maybe someone else&#39;s, who knows? It had been a big family gathering, he was sure of that. There was just the vaguest memory of what she was like, no more than an outline really, small and withered with gray hair and sharp green eyes. He thought she had passed long ago. Oh well, he couldn&#39;t remember her, but he had clearly made an impression. He had forgotten she even existed until a letter dropped through the door, saying he had inherited her fancy large estate, Oak Tree Manor, and half a million pounds. He had no idea Aunt Edith was so rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearing himself up for getting out of bed, he cursed the lack of central heating once again. Edith might have been rich, but she hadn&#39;t spent any money on utilities. William had wasted hours on the phone to various companies, wondering if they would ever be able to come out and connect the old manor up. It was a large house in the middle of nowhere and everyone he spoke to seemed to say it would take at least a month to get electricity flowing. Why would it take that long? He couldn&#39;t understand. So he was stuck with no light and roaming patches of freezing cold that seemed to seep into his bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William braced himself and got out of bed. The floorboards creaked in protest. The floor was freezing, of course. He swore under his breath and shuffled out of the bedroom, taking the candle with him. Where was he going? He didn&#39;t know. Maybe down to the library to read for a bit. That would set his mind at ease. He moved quietly through the empty manor. It felt too big for one person, too empty and echoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hand was completely frozen up. William dismissed it as the cold of the house. His other hand held the candle tight. He felt like he had travelled back in time a hundred years. The darkness shifted and shimmered around him, as if moving of its own volition. The shadows held secrets. It wasn&#39;t right, an old country house like this with only one man in it. It felt like an emptiness waiting to be filled. William was sure he could feel a strange presence around him. It was probably just his mind making something out of nothing, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corridor seemed to stretch forever. He didn&#39;t remember it being this long. It stretched into the darkness, into shadow, ongoing and vanishing in the distance. Bollocks. William was lost. He had probably gone too far, missing the turning for the stairs. He was starting to have second thoughts about the whole enterprise. The plan had been to quit his job and live on his inheritance in Oak Tree Manor, maybe write a novel or two. The only problem was, he hadn&#39;t reckoned with the house being so antiquated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now both his feet were frozen completely solid. He could barely move his toes. They seemed to creak as loudly as the house. He frowned and walked on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aunt Edith hadn&#39;t been confirmed dead, apparently. Her body had never been found. She had simply gone missing several years ago and never been found. That&#39;s why Oak Tree Manor was in such bad repair. It had lain empty and hungry for years until she was assumed dead and the will was cracked open. The whole affair was odd. Still, William had tried to put that out of his mind and focus on his unexpected good fortune. It lingered in his mind that she was here, in the house, watching him. He couldn&#39;t shake the feeling off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The corridor continued, seemingly to nowhere. William stopped. There was a howling around the windows, the wind whistling around the corners and eaves of the mansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had definitely missed the staircase. He turned back and headed back down the corridor. Each step was accompanied by a clump, clump, clump. He seemed to be moving slower. Weird. It must have been really cold in the house. Still, the movement usually warmed him up. His joints creaked the more he moved. He must have overdone when he was unpacking of all his stuff. Maybe shifted too many boxes. His arms were heavy, his back was stiff. Each step was more painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William stopped after a minute or so. He had followed the walls with the flickering candle. The staircase should have been on his right. This corridor seemed to stretch into an infinite vanishing point. There were no doors, no windows even on his right side. Nothing all the way down. He checked the left side of the corridor, but it was the same. He couldn&#39;t see where he had come from. Where was his bedroom even?  Why did the corridor seemingly go on forever?  What was going on? Nothing about this seemed right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe he should turn back. Which way had he started from? All he wanted was the staircase.  It was nowhere in sight. Nor was his bedroom. Where was he going? What was going on? Shadows flickered around the room, seemingly forming terrible shapes and mocking faces. Just a trick of the light, William told himself, just a trick of the light. That&#39;s all. The candle flame skidded and jumped around as if blown by some unseen wind. Stay calm, just stay calm, he told himself over and over. His heart raced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would go back the way he started. That would be a good idea. Retrace his steps. He must have missed the staircase. A shadow jumped, formed a mouth with sharp teeth. No illusion, it seemed so real. Just a trick, he told himself, just a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William took a step. It was slow and painful. His leg creaked as he heaved it forwards. Then he tried to take another. He couldn&#39;t move his foot. It was frozen to the floor. It was trapped by something unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He crouched down, bringing the candle with him. His leg was half covered in a brown smear, which he could barely make out in the shifting yellow light. There was a rough quality to it. William reached out a hand, seeing the same brown smear over his fingers and palm, spreading like a mould. As he looked, it grew more, heading down the hand and arm. He tapped his leg. It felt cold and solid, not like flesh any more in the slightest. It felt like wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadows flickered around him, making strange shapes. He was sure he could a mouth filled with sharp teeth, just in the corner of his eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As William watched, the brown stain spread further up his leg, up his body, spreading at a rapid pace, faster than he could see. The candle fell out of his hand as it seized up. It was extinguished as it hit the floor. William was plunged into darkness. The last thing he saw was a smiling mouth in the shadows. He didn&#39;t know what was going on. Was he sinking? He could feel the rot spread up his legs, down his arms, over his stomach, turning everything in its path to solid wood, infecting everything it touched with rapid force. He couldn&#39;t move. There was a huge creaking sound in the manor all around him, like the belly of a huge beast rumbling hungrily. His breath came short now. He couldn&#39;t move at all. His arms were seized up completely, his legs were stuck in place, his back was contorting into strange shapes, his head was forced backwards and his mouth stretched open. A scream tried to escape his mouth. He needed to scream. Nothing came out. The wood invaded his mouth and turned his last breath to sawdust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the darkness, Oak Tree Manor claimed it&#39;s latest prize.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything is a story</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-10-everything-is-a-story/" />
    <updated>2017-05-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-10-everything-is-a-story/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things reading a lot of fiction teaches you is that everything we rely on in the real world is made up. We are narrative beings and we rely on the power of stories to guide our everyday lives. Very little of our experiences and the systems we live in are based on cold facts. Most of the stories we tell ourselves do no have neat structures, with a beginning, a middle and an end, but are beliefs we hold that change how we view the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about this recently in the context of the media. Our tabloids are hugely partisan, selling stories of hate and division to sell more papers. You only need to glance at the language used in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;to see this explicitly in action. The ongoing narratives they tell change the world and have profound impacts on current events, such as Brexit last year. Still, in this age of declining newspaper sales, they are trusted beyond other forms of media. The stories they weave have considerable impact. The biases are enacted on a national scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, there is no such thing as the perfect, unbiased newspaper. I don&#39;t like the story the tabloids are selling, but the newspapers I read are still weaving a narrative. It is just one that fits my worldview better. It is simply impossible to remove all editorial bias and present the facts plainly. Even if the news was a dry list with all emotional words removed, whichever story you chose to tell first will have more impact. The placing, emphasis and selection of stories will add emphasis to some stories and remove it from others. There&#39;s no way to present the events without telling a narrative. The recent concern about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/alternative-facts/&quot;&gt;fake news &lt;/a&gt;has shown there is too much information out there. People will decide upon a viewpoint and will look for news that confirms it. Traditional media does the same thing, to a higher editorial standard. It chooses the events it considers important and shows a view of the world that is highly selective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not just the media that suffers from this narrative impulse. Each one of us suffers from selection bias. Look at how we construct our past. We tell ourselves a story of how we came to be in our current situation and where we are going. We edit memories and select ones that support the story, ignoring the others. Human beings are&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/&quot;&gt; terrible eyewitnesses&lt;/a&gt;, mostly because of this editing we do in our heads. It&#39;s the same as the media. There is too much information to process at any one time, so we select and edit. In short, we tell ourselves a story of our lives. We create ourselves based on this story every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as our sense of self being a story, the people we meet every day become characters. We meet people and within seconds we make many wide sweeping generalisations about them. From that point, it is hard to shake the assumptions we have made about them in fleeting moments. Other people become actors in a story that we make as we go along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If our whole sense of self is based on a selective narrative, then the systems and beliefs we hold about the world are subject to the same flaws. Our view of the world around us is based on a story. Which means it is incomplete. The more you look, the more you see it. History is just a story a nation tells itself to justify its existence. The economy is a story we tell based on strange, random factors. All the systems we have built, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/donald-trumps-fictional-america-post-fact-venezuela-214973&quot;&gt;every establishment&lt;/a&gt; is based on a story of how the world functions. Everything humans do and achieve starts with a narrative of where we have come from. Or alternatively, it starts with a story of what can happen in the future. The same structure recurs over and over again. Stories are not just an idle pursuit to read on a lazy sunday afternoon, they are the very essence of our being and our existence. They are essential as a tool to survive in the chaos of a random, uncaring universe. We need stories to live. It&#39;s the only way we can understand the infinite complexity around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even this article has been changed to fix a narrative. I said earlier I had thought of this when seeing the recent media bias, but that was a lie to better fit the story of the article. In reality, these ideas have been percolating for years, from several different sources and unconscious thoughts. But that didn&#39;t fit the story I was telling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can we do about it? My instinct is; there&#39;s not a lot we can do. We can be aware of our desire for narrative and seek out blind spots. We can try to work together and establish facts, no matter how hard or inconvenient. My main feeling is that humans are hardwired for storytelling, that this is how we communicate and lead our lives, through an ongoing story that we all contribute to. Writers of fiction can change the story and alter it. Stories are the basis of who we are. They have changed the world again and again. We can tell better stories together. We can change the narratives around us. After all, if everything is a tale, that means everything can be changed. We can work towards a better story, kind instead of cruel, we instead of I. We just need to tell ourselves a different narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At the End of NaPoWriMo</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-03-final-thoughts-napowrimo/" />
    <updated>2017-05-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-05-03-final-thoughts-napowrimo/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote a bit about the process &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/napowrimo-halfway-through/&quot;&gt;halfway through&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;ve finally finished &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napowrimo.net/&quot;&gt;NaPoWriMo&lt;/a&gt;, where you write a poem every single day in April. I had foolishly thought the process would be relatively straightforward, but I was drastically wrong about that. Writing so many lines over so many days was a real challenge. It was difficult to keep motivated and continue writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halfway through the process, I forgot exactly what poetry is. Nothing seemed to make sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;  
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Started &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/napowrimo?src=hash&quot;&gt;#napowrimo&lt;/a&gt; with a vague idea of what a poem was, even if i couldn&#39;t write it. Now I have no idea  
— David Lewis (@davidralphlewis) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/davidralphlewis/status/852614457712926726&quot;&gt;April 13, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&gt;  
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I lost confidence in my writing. Poetry felt like a vague, incomprehensible mess. Unlike short stories, which rely on a clear structure, I struggled to find clear rules for poetry. I didn&#39;t know the rules of the game and therefore I did not know how to change them. I lost faith in what I was writing. I still wrote every day, but with limited faith in what I was doing. Hence this poem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;h1&gt;Dreams&lt;/h1&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This poem for you was meant to be&lt;br&gt;
a gilded palace, ornate and impossible,&lt;br&gt;
beautiful in its endless splendour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poem for you was meant to be&lt;br&gt;
filled with pleasure gardens, a maze&lt;br&gt;
of rooms and libraries stocked&lt;br&gt;
to interrogate the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poem for you was going to be&lt;br&gt;
carved at the top of a mountain&lt;br&gt;
Over thousands of years, taking&lt;br&gt;
generations to haul boulders&lt;br&gt;
up the steepest slope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This poem for you was actually&lt;br&gt;
a long abandoned hut&lt;br&gt;
in the middle of a forgotten&lt;br&gt;
forest, blackened walls crawling&lt;br&gt;
with vines beginning their&lt;br&gt;
slow sombre embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve long since praised the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/the-importance-of-a-creative-routine/&quot;&gt;a daily routine&lt;/a&gt; and it was this that eventually pulled me through. I stopped worrying about the quality of what I was producing and eventually just got on with the business with writing it. The daily routine helped because it didn&#39;t give me time to give into the fear that my writing was trite. Instead, I just had to push forward and write the damn things. Are they any good? I don&#39;t know. What I do know is that I now have thirty poems to edit and mess around with. Fear of the blank page is what stops many people writing, but once the poems have been written they can be shaped and edited. Now, I have something to work with. Here&#39;s another written during the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Trap&lt;/h1&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;These four walls&lt;br&gt;
bleached white&lt;br&gt;
but not by the sun&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decorated with electric&lt;br&gt;
blue bolts, hundreds paper&lt;br&gt;
every smooth surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In here, I have made&lt;br&gt;
myself at home.&lt;br&gt;
Arrange furniture so&lt;br&gt;
I recline in comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing dust settle like&lt;br&gt;
rain, I snap open&lt;br&gt;
curtains to let the&lt;br&gt;
unlikely light in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll never leave&lt;br&gt;
but I never think of it&lt;br&gt;
as a prison. It is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I have ever known.&lt;br&gt;
All I ever will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The whole process has shown me I still have a lot to learn. With any creative art, just scratching the surface reveals a whole world you were previously unaware of. This process has shown me there are thousands of modern poets I have little to no idea about. There are endless forms and metaphors that I can play around with. There&#39;s a huge community I knew nothing about. On the days I struggled to find inspiration, there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://vagabondly.tumblr.com/post/158973397731/a-source-of-prompts-prompt-listings-for&quot;&gt;endless prompts&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://belljarblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/19/naporemo-19-plus-ca-change/&quot;&gt; help&lt;/a&gt; online. From this point, I want to read even wider to expand my knowledge of this art form. NaPoWriMo may not have given me anything I&#39;m majorly proud with, but it&#39;s certainly given me a start along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s one last poem written during the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Watching&lt;/h1&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;From above, lives are blinking&lt;br&gt;
pixels on a faulty monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In black and white, flat-roofed&lt;br&gt;
buildings are merely blank spaces&lt;br&gt;
waiting to be filled with cracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, a scatter of static&lt;br&gt;
as I fly overhead, unseen&lt;br&gt;
and unmanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no rules anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can decide at any time&lt;br&gt;
to reset the screen&lt;br&gt;
wipe it clean and&lt;br&gt;
start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fly onwards, invisible&lt;br&gt;
in the choking cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jerusalem, Ambition and the Power of Ideas</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-26-jerusalem-ambition-power-of-ideas/" />
    <updated>2017-04-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-26-jerusalem-ambition-power-of-ideas/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s taken me three and a half months, but I finally finished Alan Moore&#39;s magnum opus &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt;.  Made of a number of interlinked short stories set in Northampton, it tells the history of the town as well as the nature of life, death and time itself. It is ridiculously broad in its scope while remaining funny and down to earth, with a serious message about the abuse of the working class. The entire second book occurs whilst a child is choking on a sweet. Each chapter, especially in the last book, uses its own style. There&#39;s an epic poem, a play, a Joycean wordplay chapter. In short, it is a hugely ambitious work that in my opinion succeeds wholeheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/the-bone-clocks-by-david-mitchell/&quot;&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about how artists shouldn&#39;t be afraid to take risks, in reference to David Mitchell&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Bone Clocks&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt; is another step beyond in terms of ambition. It&#39;s a detailed history with characters that interweave with other stories in wholly unexpected ways. It is a novel that demands you pay attention, from the first intricate sentences to the final chapter. It can almost be seen as a challenge, such is the scale of the novel. But this is a deliberate tactic, as this novel has complex, rich ideas about time and the evolution of society. It&#39;s worth paying attention to closely and considering the ideas within. The writing style is ornate because it demands your attention and forces you to focus on the novel. It&#39;s not going to be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, but if you can click into the rich language it gives back in spades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s inspiring as a writer to read something so ridiculously epic. Alan Moore acknowledges this in an interview about the book, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, just as much as I intended &lt;em&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/em&gt; for everybody, for ordinary people, for anybody who happens to be living a life in the world at this moment, I meant it for artists and writers as well. I wanted to do something that was stupidly ambitious to show that there is still room for these things. The world has not contracted as much as you may believe. The interior of the human head is infinite.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;[Full interview &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/blog/interviews/interior-human-head-infinite-conversation-alan-moore&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;What Moore is arguing for is that writers shouldn&#39;t be afraid of imagination. If you find a piece of work going in a strange new direction, embrace it. *Jerusalem* is the greatest example of this, with a plot that doesn&#39;t make sense on paper at all. The actual experience of it, however, is overwhelming and it all ties together. The imagination of Moore guides the novel and sends it in strange new directions. Moore is also arguing with *Jerusalem* not to be scared of being too ambitious when creating art. Aim higher for ridiculous projects and you might just create something wonderful. Sure, *Jerusalem* may put some people off, but you cannot deny the sheer scale and achievement of the novel. The language reflects one of Moore&#39;s central themes as well, that of the richness and beauty of every single moment and day. The book is a rallying call for all artists to push themselves further and aim higher, to not just be satisfied with creating the same things or to stick to the status quo.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Alan Moore is arguing for the power of art to bring new ideas and even create them during the process. *Jerusalem* introduced the concept of time as a solid dimension, with your consciousness experiencing it linearly. It is only once we are dead that we can see the whole of our lives spread out before us like frozen moments, before jumping back in and starting the whole sequence again. It is a unique idea that impacts every single story in the book, while also linking them all together. This concept explains the ghosts, as well as the sense of deja-vu that characters experience. This concept could be quite academic, but within the bounds of  *Jerusalem*, it becomes easier to digest. It is drip fed to you slowly over the course of the first book and expanded up in the second. It becomes easier to understand as the story becomes the conduit for the idea. By using our imagination we can grasp it easier.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Ultimately, this smuggling of deep concepts through fiction is why Moore still argues for the power of art to change the world. The novel&#39;s last book is concerned with the working class and the poor now being seen as a problem to be managed.  It shows the abstraction of money and how the dangerous concepts started in Northampton alongside as the practice of hiding abused women in madhouses. *Jerusalem* argues that art is not only able to tackle these subjects but that it can end up changing the world. Art is able to highlight and expose issues, using the imagination to fictionalise them and tell the audience a story. We are narrative creatures and as such a good story can change our thinking and then impact the world around us. This is the true power of big ideas in fiction, the impact they have on the wider world around us and how they can change the audience&#39;s mind. This is why Moore argues for the power of the imagination because he knows what impact it can have. Be bold and take risks, because the strange ideas you come up with may influence countless others in many unseen ways.  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Of course, such a small blog post like this can only scratch the surface. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve over-simplified and glossed over some important details. That&#39;s why the real pleasure of discovery comes from reading the novel itself, all 1200 pages of it. It may not be for everyone but I urge you to dive in and immerse yourself in Moore&#39;s vision. It&#39;s hugely ambitious and may not work for you, but Moore shows that it is better to aim for the sky and miss than to play it safe.

    <title>NaPoWriMo Halfway through</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-19-napowrimo-halfway-through/" />
    <updated>2017-04-19T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-19-napowrimo-halfway-through/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the month of April, I have tried to write a poem a day for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.napowrimo.net/&quot;&gt;NaPoWriMo&lt;/a&gt; (National Poetry Writing Month.) It&#39;s been surprisingly difficult to find a different theme or story each day. Nevertheless, I feel the process has pushed me forward as a writer by sending me into unknown areas. It&#39;s giving me much needed rigour and discipline. I consider myself to be an amateur, with less experience in poetry than in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/amberstars/&quot;&gt;short stories&lt;/a&gt; or plays. I only started writing poetry again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/rediscovering-poetry/&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and even then it was fairly occasional. Forcing myself to write a poem a day has been a boon, as I have tried to improve each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t shared all of them because I feel most are fairly poor and in need of serious editing. However, here are a few. This first one was written early in the process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;h2&gt;#Nofilter&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I reach this summit after&lt;br&gt;
Hauling my bag of bones and fat&lt;br&gt;
Up the slope, I see magnificence.&lt;br&gt;
A rolling vista of plenty spread before&lt;br&gt;
My weary eyes, perfectly lit by the&lt;br&gt;
Rotating earth and the apparently sinking&lt;br&gt;
Sun. I take a picture of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surely, this a glimpse of the infinite.&lt;br&gt;
I am staggered by-&lt;br&gt;
Oh, a couple of retweets and a like.&lt;br&gt;
Staggered by the view, by the simple act o&lt;br&gt;
of living and-&lt;br&gt;
Heh.&lt;br&gt;
That reply is actually quite funny.&lt;br&gt;
Nature in all its majesty is-&lt;br&gt;
Oh a couple of likes on Instagram as well.&lt;br&gt;
Cool.&lt;br&gt;
That thread on Twitter is still going.&lt;br&gt;
I find the perfect meme&lt;br&gt;
Reply back.&lt;br&gt;
Back to Instagram while I wait, maybe Facebook&lt;br&gt;
although Facebook is dead, no one is using Facebook anymore, why are you on Facebook? I check it anyway, just to see. Nothing of course.&lt;br&gt;
Back to Twitter one last time. Nah, Nothing.&lt;br&gt;
Wait&lt;br&gt;
Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tear my eyes away from the feed&lt;br&gt;
To see hills darkening&lt;br&gt;
And a wind starting to whisper&lt;br&gt;
Bringing with it the promise of ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This next one was written on the 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Opacity&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You stalk the streets, a shadow&lt;br&gt;
hunting for a solid object to link to.&lt;br&gt;
You haunt dimly-lit coffee shops,&lt;br&gt;
wondering if you have been downgraded&lt;br&gt;
from translucent to invisible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the bitter taste of ashes&lt;br&gt;
on your tongue. You avoid street&lt;br&gt;
lamps, not wanting the light to burn&lt;br&gt;
away your essence. You are awake&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At half three in an unknown part&lt;br&gt;
of this strange city, far away from home.&lt;br&gt;
You are avoiding eye contact. You are&lt;br&gt;
walking. Why are you walking?&lt;br&gt;
Where are you going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are swaying in flourescent churches&lt;br&gt;
with little memory of the journey.&lt;br&gt;
You are waiting for the dawn&lt;br&gt;
Although you know it will evaporate you&lt;br&gt;
like dew from a leaf. You wonder&lt;br&gt;
how to spend your cursed seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will wait with you,&lt;br&gt;
Sit with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This last one was written today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Coverings over bones&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Casually discarded at the bottom&lt;br&gt;
of the dark cave wardrobe, creased&lt;br&gt;
into a ball by time and worn by&lt;br&gt;
pressure and clothes above,&lt;br&gt;
you find an ancient relic of a jumper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flour is still caked on the sleeve.&lt;br&gt;
It was meant to be washed years&lt;br&gt;
ago, but slipped through the cracks&lt;br&gt;
of minutes, sunk through the soil&lt;br&gt;
of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run your fingers over&lt;br&gt;
the deep creases, the frayed sleeve&lt;br&gt;
that your thumb always hooked in&lt;br&gt;
the hole under the armpit&lt;br&gt;
you always meant to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exhumed, it releases to the surface&lt;br&gt;
a memory of making bread, the taste&lt;br&gt;
long forgotten; lazy Sunday afternoons&lt;br&gt;
and the faintest history of the person&lt;br&gt;
you always yearned to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a fun challenge and even if the poetry is no good, I&#39;ve enjoyed pushing myself into a new area of writing. I&#39;ll share some more once April is up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tourmaline: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-05-tourmaline/" />
    <updated>2017-04-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-04-05-tourmaline/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flash fiction created in response to Chuck Wendig&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/03/31/flash-fiction-challenge-one-word-titles/&quot;&gt;prompts&lt;/a&gt;. Enjoy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunflower grabbed at the smooth black pendant hanging around her neck. It was still there. The electric stone. Thank you, she said to herself, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where was she? There were bright lights above her. The sense of movement. She was on her back, lying down. How did she get here? She lurched upward. The world swum around her, blurring like an out of focus camera. Someone was shouting. Someone else was speaking calmly to her, quietly. She couldn&#39;t understand the words. They were English, but they might have been another language for all she understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Sunflower blinked and she was once again prone, staring wildly at the ceiling once more. Once more she grasped the crystal. Once more, she was reassured that it was still there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She remembered being out for lunch with her friends, eating a new restaurant in the centre of town. They didn&#39;t have much she could eat and Sunflower remembered feeling annoyed at that. Mind you, her appetite had been fading recently. Most days, she could barely force down a couple of slices of toast. Still, the advantage of not wanting to eat anything was that she had lost loads of weight. Her friends had complimented her about how thin she was looking. How there wasn&#39;t any fat on her, not anymore. How she was almost a skeleton. At least, she thought that&#39;s what they said. They could have said anything. Her hearing had been fading in and out as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, her food had arrived. A bowl of plain pasta, a little bit of olive oil drizzled over the top and some cracked black pepper. Not ideal but it had been all they had. The smell of peppercorns and the fragrant oil had invaded her nostrils. She had felt nauseous in a wave. Suddenly, she had felt like she was going to vomit all over the plate in the restaurant. The world had seemed distant like looking through a tunnel. Had she tried to stand up? She thought maybe she had. That was the last thing she could remember from her lunch. Now she was speeding to an unknown destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Try to breathe.&#39; Someone said, in that calm reassuring voice. They were next to her ear, but she couldn&#39;t quite summon up the energy to turn her head. She could only stare at the ceiling, feeling the lull of movement as she sped along. She nodded and breathed deeply. She had the tourmaline round her neck, so all would be well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day it had turned up it seemed so innocuous. It should have come with a warning label. It really needed big stickers that said DANGER and DO NOT OPERATE WITHOUT INSTRUCTION. The power contained within was too much. Instead, it had just turned up in the post one day in a plain brown box. When she took it out for the first time, she had gasped. It was beautiful. The smooth black crystal was unlike anything else she had ever seen. A beautiful smooth mirror, completely opaque and mysterious. She tried the tourmaline as soon as she got into her flat, burning some paper to create ash. In the middle of the ashes she placed the crystal. It drew the ashes closer. Perfect. It was genuine. It was the electric stone. One of the rare crystals. She had smiled. It was what she needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trolley or bed she was on started moving. There were flashing blue lights and a glimpse of the night sky. Then another corridor, another building and it seemed so familiar, but she couldn&#39;t place it. Then she stopped. People were passing by her in blue and red smocks, not looking at her. Someone said her old name, then a long list of words that she couldn&#39;t understand. All latin terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It hit her like an awakening. The panic overwhelmed Sunflower as the world swum into focus. Her breathing was fast, her face was hot. She was in a hospital. They had taken her to the hospital. She didn&#39;t want to be here but couldn&#39;t move. She was too weak. Why was she here? This was the worst thing that could happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she had got the diagnosis, she had cried for days. She had barely left her flat, just sat on her worn sofa staring into space. Her doctor had wanted her to have treatment, but what did doctors know? The treatments could have been worse than the illness. Her mum had been so weak towards the end. Sunflower was not going to be another statistic for big pharma. Her body would be on a slab in a basement, carved up and cut up like an animal. She couldn&#39;t bear that. The treatments would have made you sicker. She didn&#39;t want that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So she had done some research online into alternate therapies. Things the doctor wouldn&#39;t tell her, because she was being paid by the drug companies. There were pages of people claiming the tourmaline had healed them completely. It attracted the toxins in your body, drawing them out, making you better. It was less invasive and more powerful, but the research was being suppressed. She had ordered it that day and worn it around her neck every day, feeling better and stronger. Until that day in the restaurant, she had been feeling mostly better. Mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunflower waited until the nurses and orderlies had stopped fussing around her. They took her clothes off and put her tourmaline beside her. She bided her time until night. In the dark, she summoned up all her strength and shifted her weight out of bed. Her hands grasped the electric crystal tight. She wouldn&#39;t stay and be a pawn for big pharma. She had her own medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not making eye contact with anyone, Sunflower slowly shuffled down the quiet corridor and out into the night. Her hand held her tourmaline for dear life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My accidental novel: Thoughts on first drafts</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-29-accidental-novel-thoughts-first-drafts/" />
    <updated>2017-03-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-29-accidental-novel-thoughts-first-drafts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I accidentally wrote a novel. Well, it certainly started that way. I started working on a short story in December, setting out a really basic outline and running with it. After about ten thousand words, I realised I had barely scratched the surface. Clearly, this short story was something more expansive. The story demanded a larger setting. So I continued on until finally, last weekend, I typed THE END. What was a short story has now turned into something approaching short novel length. I had very little idea what I was doing and even less of an idea on how I was doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It is incredibly satisfying to get to the end of a draft, especially with a longer project such as a novel. Typically, I have written &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/amberstars/&quot;&gt;short stories &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/remain-vigilant/&quot;&gt;plays&lt;/a&gt;. Getting to the end of a first draft with these formats is quick and satisfying. It can take less than a week sometimes. Obviously, a novel is going to take longer, even if you write fast. It took me about three months to get to the end of a first draft, writing  3000-4000 words a week on average. I found it hard to sustain a consistent approach during that time and to focus on the story. It changes and mutates under your fingers, depending on what is happening that day. As such, simply getting to the end feels like a satisfying achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the muddled development, the book is an absolute mess. Plot strands start and splutter out never to be referred to again. There&#39;s not much of a structure and I&#39;m not sure the central mystery makes sense. Even the protagonist&#39;s motivations and voice changes throughout the book, being radically different to the first paragraphs. I changed my mind on the main antagonists as well, making them quite sympathetic. I ended up taking their side. It&#39;s going to take a lot of editing to make it even vaguely readable and to force it to make sense.  This was part of the difficulty in pushing through to reach the end. I kept thinking of major changes I would need to make at the start of the novel in order to make the rest of it make sense. The problem was, most of it wasn&#39;t a simple word change or paragraph change here or there, it was rewriting the beginning. So I pushed on through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am glad I carried on to the bitter end. Through the writing, I made a hundred decisions about character and situations. Each small decision on a sentence level impacts the next. This is how the big decisions are made about character. This is how I found the voice of my protagonist. Through small decisions in the writing process, I found out what the story was really about. Minor characters took on greater prominence as I wrote and eventually impacted the story. All of these small decisions help to change the novel and will ultimately inform the second draft. When I come to rewrite the novel, it will be much richer for having blundered through the first draft, far more than a detailed outline would have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first draft is terrible by design. The novel is a word vomit mess, full of inconsistencies and terrible sentences. It is also necessary. As well as giving me much more of an idea of an outline, it also is something to work from. Once the story is on the page, even in its roughest format, it can be reshaped and edited, honed and perfected. The real work begins in the second draft, rewriting to make it better. The point of a first draft is therefore just to push through the words, get them down onto the page, so you can change them all later. That&#39;s not to say the process is no fun, in fact, it is the most imaginative and exciting times in the whole process. You can go anywhere and make anything happen in the first draft, no matter how crazy or inconsequential. There is boundless creativity in the first draft, even as you grind out the words to meet the word count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all subjective of course. I knew writers who would work to a meticulous outline, plan the whole book out before they came to write it. Others may be a bit of bot, using an outline but deviating from it as they write. I like to have the barest bones of a story, then figure out what is happening or what the story is about along the way. This is not to say it is right, it is simply the bet way I have found for my process. Whether you use an outline or not, the first draft is a heady rush of excitement and creativity. At the end of it, in whatever terrible form it may take, you have a novel. Then you can get to work making it better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jabberwocky Remixed</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-23-jabberwocky-remixed/" />
    <updated>2017-03-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-23-jabberwocky-remixed/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://poetryasf-ck.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Poetry as Fuck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://imaginaryadvice.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Imaginary Advice&lt;/a&gt;, I spent a morning remixing* Jabberwocky* by Lewis Carrol. Because...? I&#39;m not really sure why. Anyway, here are the results. In this first one, I replaced words with common names. Weirdly, it still makes a sort of sense:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jerry-Walt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Twas Bradley, and the Susan Todd&#39;s&lt;br&gt;
Did Gary and Genevieve in the Wade:&lt;br&gt;
All Maureen were the Bernie-Gregs,&lt;br&gt;
And the Mae Rolfs out-Gabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beware the Jerry-Walt, my son!&lt;br&gt;
The Jakes that bite, the Calum that catch!&lt;br&gt;
Beware the John-John bird, and shun&lt;br&gt;
The Francesca Barnaby-Sam!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took his Vinny sword in hand:&lt;br&gt;
Long time the Mackenzie foe he sought --&lt;br&gt;
So rested he by the TomTom tree,&lt;br&gt;
And stood awhile in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, as in Ulrich thought he stood,&lt;br&gt;
The Jerry-Walt, with eyes of Fay,&lt;br&gt;
Came Whitney through the Tammy wood,&lt;br&gt;
And Barry-ed as it came!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, two! One, two! And through and through&lt;br&gt;
The Vinny blade went Simon-Sid!&lt;br&gt;
He left it dead, and with its Hugh&lt;br&gt;
He went Gareth-ing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And, has thou slain the Jerry-Walt?&lt;br&gt;
Come to my arms, my Bethany boy!&lt;br&gt;
O Frederica day! Carlos! Casey!&#39;&lt;br&gt;
He Charlotte-d in his joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Twas Bradley, and the Susan Todd&#39;s&lt;br&gt;
Did Gary and Genevieve in the Wade:&lt;br&gt;
All Maureen were the Bernie-Gregs,&lt;br&gt;
And the Mae Rolfs out-Gabe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second, I translated the poem into Arabic and then back into English:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Jabrok&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Tuas Preleg, and Tuthili Slythi&lt;br&gt;
Are Gir and Gamble in Webby:&lt;br&gt;
All Mimsey Boroughves,&lt;br&gt;
And Momi Rathas Uttragabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Beware of Jabrok, my son!&lt;br&gt;
Jaws that bite, claws that catch!&lt;br&gt;
Beware the birds of Gobjub, and Shawn&lt;br&gt;
And Banderzenach is reckless!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His sword of Forbal was at hand:&lt;br&gt;
Manxum&#39;s long-sought enemy -&lt;br&gt;
So rested is by Tomtom tree,&lt;br&gt;
I stood a moment in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Ovech I think he stood up,&lt;br&gt;
And Jabrok, with the eyes of the flame,&lt;br&gt;
Nfling came through the Tulji wood,&lt;br&gt;
And Bourbard also came!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, two! One, two! It is through and through&lt;br&gt;
I went for the Sniper-Forbal blade - a snack!&lt;br&gt;
Leave him dead, and with his head&lt;br&gt;
He went back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did you kill Jabrok?&lt;br&gt;
Come to my arm, boy boy!&lt;br&gt;
O Frabgos today! Calo! Calai!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
So he rose in joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`Tuas Preleg, and Tuthili Slythi&lt;br&gt;
Gir and Gimpel in Webby.&lt;br&gt;
All Mimsey Boroughves,&lt;br&gt;
And Momi Rathas Uttragabi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, like I have done previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/feeding-my-writing-through-a-digital-shredder/&quot;&gt;with my own poems&lt;/a&gt;, I used a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Gibber/GibGen.htm&quot;&gt;Markov chain generator&lt;/a&gt; to break the poem and re-edited it into a new, grimmer version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Borogove&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borogove, (from the slithy manxome)&lt;br&gt;
Came to frumious Jubjub,&lt;br&gt;
took a looking-glass to his eyes&lt;br&gt;
and saw all were in thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The catch! Catch! Outgrabe&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;
burbled Borogove in flame.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Beware! The toves do gyre!&lt;br&gt;
Raths are the mimsy! Beware!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vorpal brillig came whiffling&lt;br&gt;
through the back blade, with eyes&lt;br&gt;
in hand. Borogove was left dead,&lt;br&gt;
resting by the tulgey wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alice found him there,&lt;br&gt;
jaws slithy and his gimble slain.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;quot;Callooh! Callooh! Callooh! Callooh!&lt;br&gt;
My mome boy! My bandersnatch bird!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long time she uffish stood&lt;br&gt;
in burbled thought. Snicker-snack&lt;br&gt;
went the callay claws.&lt;br&gt;
Snicker-snack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s it for now. I might do more in the future. I hope you enjoyed them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Distraction by Design: Observations on Television</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-22-distraction-by-design/" />
    <updated>2017-03-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-22-distraction-by-design/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over three years ago, I stopped watching TV. I didn&#39;t have one in the house I was in, so I just stopped. At first, it was strange to not constantly have noise and visual distraction. But soon, I didn&#39;t miss it. I preferred the silence and space to think, giving myself time to immerse myself in reading and writing. Television felt mind-numbing in comparison. I did not miss switching my brain off. In the same way as I occasionally need to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/step-away-from-the-internet/&quot;&gt;disconnect from the internet&lt;/a&gt; to improve my attention, I never got another television because I found myself more attentive and more engaged with the world around me. As these things usually go, it soon became a pledge. I didn&#39;t need television and I could no longer understand the obsession with it. Sure, this removed me out of a lot of conversations, but I preferred the space and time not watching the box gave me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Watching television is essentially a passive act. You sit while not taking part in anything. Reading is also passive, but I have found it engages my brain in a way that television doesn&#39;t. I think of new ideas and learn new things. I have not found that to be the case with television. It is not that the form is inherently bad because there are swathes of fantastic television out there, interesting drama and brilliant educational documentaries. The problem comes with passive watching, surfing channels to find something to watch just for the sake of it. Filling endless evenings with shows you do not care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without television, I have found some peace and worked harder to improve myself.  I watch the occasional show, but only on catch up and only once or twice a week. But in the last couple of weeks, the news has been on in the office at the day job and I have found myself staring at the idiot box once more. Here are a few things I have noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Advertising is loud and distracting by design&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten what television adverts were like. I had missed out on most of them and was able to block the majority of adverts out from my life. I found myself buying things because I needed them instead of what I thought I wanted. Watching television again, I realise how loud and crass most of them are. This is by design as they only have thirty seconds to hammer themselves into your head. They need to be as loud and attention grabbing as possible to force your attention to the screen. They are unsubtle in their messages, even less than I remember. Buy this and your life will improve. Use our service and we will save you time. Your dreams will come true. It&#39;s such an incessant, unrelenting narrative that it is hard to see why anyone would fall for it. But we do because even if you are a snob like me, television hammers the adverts into your brain every 15 minutes. If you watch the same channel for long enough you can quote the adverts word for word. Adverts crawl into your head through constant repetition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TV is designed for the lowest common denominator&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;No surprise here. Like advertising, this was something I knew already, even when I was watching it regularly. This has just become more obvious from the continual absence. There are constant recaps of what you have already seen and summaries of what is coming up. It is intentional, as it allows you to jump in at any point and continue watching. It also captures your attention as you wait for upcoming segments. The problem is, it removes the educate part from educate, inform and entertain. There is the opportunity to learn so much about the world, but 90% of television will not educate anyone. Ask yourself, when was the last time you actually learnt something new from a program on television. It treats the audience as if they were stupid in order not to alienate anyone and to keep your attention for as long as possible. Why? To sell you more stuff of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rolling news is terrible&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;90% of the programs are a waste of time. Sure, every so often there is &lt;em&gt;The Wire&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Planet Earth&lt;/em&gt;, but the majority are pointless diversions to capture your attention. This is doubly true of rolling news. I think I had watched it in passing before, in reception areas or to see the headlines. Having it constantly on in the office shows me how painful it is. With hours to fill, the news should be able to cover a range of issues, informing the public on multiple events happening around the world. Instead, it focuses on three or four stories a day and discusses them endlessly. Everything has to be a debate no matter how minor the point or how petty the argument. This does not increase complexity as you might imagine but reduces everything to a simple binary. Rolling news spend most of the day speculating about events that it knows are going to happen, showing those events, then spending the rest of the day talking about what actually happened. The only use for rolling news is when a world-changing event happens, but those are incredibly rare. It&#39;s a waste of time and space for the majority of its existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Despite it all, I still can&#39;t help watching.&lt;/h2&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;My eyes get continually drawn to television&#39;s movement, lulled by its bright lights. A story on the rolling news will catch my attention, usually about Brexit or Trump and the like. I will usually disagree and it will give me something to be angry about. I know all of what I have argued is true and yet I cannot stop watching. The tactics used to capture people&#39;s attention are still effective on me. Of course they are, they have been refined over years to be irresistible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t blame anyone for wanting some escape after a hard day at work. Life is hard and people need to escape from it sometimes, turn their brain off and switch off and I get that. At the moment as well, television drama is the best it has ever been. I get the appeal of following different stories over multiple weeks. But I think it is worth being attentive to what watch and to ask yourself if you are actually getting anything out of the experience. Too often television becomes the default entertainment for an evening and too often people become passive slaves to the glowing box in the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The New Religion of Brexit</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-15-the-new-religion-of-brexit/" />
    <updated>2017-03-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-15-the-new-religion-of-brexit/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, after 9 months of legal battles and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/with-us-or-against-us-brexit-and-the-daily-mail/&quot;&gt;back and forth&lt;/a&gt; in parliament, it looks like Article 50 is about to be triggered and the UK can start its negotiations with the EU. No going back from that point. It seems since the vote months ago that hard Brexit is now a religion, an unstoppable dogma that cannot be argued with. The UK is willing to sacrifice almost everything for the promised hard Brexit. Turn this island into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/theresa-may-threatens-eu-with-tax-haven-hard-brexit-plan-ready-to-do-so-if-eu-blocks-trade-migration-deal_uk_587cbbdae4b04a8bfe6af15b&quot;&gt;tax haven?&lt;/a&gt; Sure, why not. Public Services? Tories were getting rid of them anyway. Even the United Kingdom itself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/second-scottish-independence-live-referendum-nicola-sturgeon-brexit-speech-second-indy-ref-2-uk-eu-a7626746.html&quot;&gt;is being sacrificed&lt;/a&gt; on the pyre. It&#39;s become an absolute destination and damn the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Hard Brexit has become a religion. It is a faith-based political manoeuvre. Brexit will save the country, give the people back control. Never mind the facts. The Prime Minister has attacked the problem of leaving the European with religious zeal. She wasn&#39;t signed up before, as she campaigned for Remain, but now she is a true believer and has seen the light. Like all those who are born again, she is vehement and absolute in her belief. Now she has just gained the power to trigger Article 50 by herself, instead of parliament triggering it. She has pushed for absolute power and been granted it. Throughout the discussions in parliament, The Prime Minister and the government have been dogmatic in their insistence that they are doing the right thing. They have refused to listen to any objections, about EU nationals or about parliament having the final say. It is the tactics of a bully or a cult leader. There has been little or no objection from Labour, who have allowed this hard Brexit to flourish. Everyone is worshiping at the altar of hard Brexit. The religious fervour has infected everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not just the government who have dug their heels in, it is many of those who voted for it. The true faith has gripped everyone, absolute and unwavering. Any discussion about the alternative outcomes or tactics has been shouted down. Those who question the government&#39;s tactics in preparing for Brexit are exiled from the congregation and called remoaners. In a fine example of cognitive dissonance, those who think they have made a bad choice or were unsure are now absolute believers in the glory of full Brexit. They cannot bear to be challenged because the belief transcends facts or information. The belief is all that counts. It is what sustains people now the battle is over. It&#39;s religion without proof, the definition of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has drunk so much of the kool-aid that the recent announcement of a new Scottish referendum for independence came as a broadside and a surprise. But it shouldn&#39;t have done. Theresa May has refused to listen to anyone or speak with anyone about her plans for Brexit. Instead of consulting the devolved powers and being open about her plans for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU, the Prime Minister has shrouded everything in a veil of secrecy. She is a cult leader, unwilling to completely divulge all the mysteries to keep people believing. She believes herself to be absolutely in the right. Never mind that the United Kingdom may break up because of the tactics she has chosen. Scotland is merely an inconvenience. Many of the people who voted Brexit are saying they never needed Scotland anyway. There is anger that they are interfering in the one true path. Brexit is the destination. Brexit is the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worry that as we approach the important negotiations, this strong-arm secrecy is only going to harm the UK. The whole point of negotiations is to listen to the other side, to compromise and to find common ground. To find a deal that is mutually beneficial to both sides. We head into this most crucial time for the UK with an unelected Prime Minister who is unwilling to listen to objections and with only the promises of politicians to keep our rights and the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The only problem is that politician&#39;s promises are made of smoke and at the slightest puff of wind they vanish into thin air. We go into these negotiations with nothing, demanding very little from the EU, having angered many of the nations with our callous, destructive approach. It is the worst way to go ahead. It is going to be like arguing with a brick wall as small, insignificant UK attempts to threaten something larger than itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is most frustrating about the situation is that it didn&#39;t have to be this way. Sure, Brexit was a necessity. It needed to happen, especially after the vote. But it did not need to happen in this destructive, dangerous way. The government could have been open about their plans. They could have listened to the concerns of those who voted to stay and those who voted to leave. They could have addressed them all as much as possible and gone into the negotiations with a clear plan, having not alienated member states of the EU. The vote was to leave the EU, not necessarily in this extreme way. The religious fever took hold and now we have Brexit by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know what is going to happen in the next two years. No one does. That is why it is important to be suspicious of anyone who claims absolute knowledge about how the negotiations are going to go down. Especially if that person happens to be the Prime Minister. I just hope this fever is shaken off soon and people start to realise that hard Brexit isn&#39;t the holy land after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good Boy: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-08-good-boy/" />
    <updated>2017-03-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-08-good-boy/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Prompt from here]http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/03/03/flash-fiction-challenge-right-vs-wrong/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am at a stage in my life where the internet is my only source of life advice. After the divorce, then the breakdown, I have very few friends left. No one in fact. My therapist was no use to me, a newly trained child with no time to do anything but read from a textbook. I feel like an alien, able to observe humans at a distance but never able to connect with them. So I find myself endlessly typing questions into Google. How do I improve my life? How do I make friends? How do I stop crying at random times?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the articles is simple. It says THE ONE TRICK TO IMPROVE YOUR LIFE is to do a good deed for another person, every day. With nothing left to lose, I think, why not? So I leave my house for the first time in months. The light is blinding, but I steady my feet and walk to the town. I&#39;m looking for a good deed to do. I want to do someone a favour. Everyone looks so content and perfectly happy. I don&#39;t want to ask anyone, that would be weird. So I walk around, hoping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m about to give up when I see her: a little old lady and her dog waiting on one side of the side to cross. The old lady is peering at the red figure trying to figure out whether to cross. I quickly walk up to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Need a hand? I&#39;ll see you across&#39; I say. I take her arm before she can object. She mumbles something incomprehensible at me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light turns green and I walk across the road, dragging the small woman behind me. I&#39;m doing it, I think., I&#39;m doing a good deed. A little part of my soul that has been shrouded in darkness until now lights up, just a little bit. The old lady is pulling at my arm and seems to be heaving back, but I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m doing good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get to the other side and let go of her arm. &#39;There you go love.&#39; I say. I almost manage a smile before she hits me with her handbag. The pain explodes in my arm. What has she got in there, bricks?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Bloody idiot! What have you done?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;But, I-&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another whack on my other arm. She&#39;s stronger than she looks. Then she starts shouting at the top of her voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Ginger! GINGER!&#39; For a moment I&#39;m confused. I have brown hair, not orange. Then I see the dog, sat on the other side of the road with a stupid expression on it&#39;s face. It sits there for a moment, wondering where the noise is coming from. Then it picks itself up and trots slowly into the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only by now the light has changed to red. The old woman screams as Ginger gets hit by the wheels of a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car doesn&#39;t even stop. All I can hear is her screaming. I run out into the road, holding my hand out to stop the cars coming past. I can see it&#39;s too late. Poor little Ginger&#39;s body is broken in several places. I scoop it up in my arms as best I can and head back to the old woman, cradling the body of her dog. She just looks at me and wails. People are turning to look at us now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;I&#39;m so so sorry.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;What have you done?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;If there is anything I can do, anything, I&#39;ll do it.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She quietens a little bit. It&#39;s almost worse. She&#39;s just looking at the body. It&#39;s heavy and damp in my arms. It&#39;s a long time before she is able to say anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Bring him home for me, will you?&#39; She finally says. I nod. Of course, I have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We move slowly through the streets, a bizarre funeral procession with her leading in front and me carrying the body behind her. People turn and look. I try to hide away, but there&#39;s no hiding from their disappointed eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s dusk by the time we reach her house, a small terraced house on the edge of town. I wait on the edge of her property as she opens her gate, then fiddles with a large chain of keys. she opens the door and turns to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Can you bring him in?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I nod again and cross the threshold. She closes the door behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s pitch black in her house. I can&#39;t see a thing. There&#39;s no reference point. I hear her hobbling off down a corridor. I&#39;m left in the darkness. My eyes try to struggle on any point of light, but there isn&#39;t any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;You can put Ginger down now.&#39; She says, her voice coming from somewhere distant.  The house seemed so much bigger than it looked from the outside. I took a couple of steps forward, not wanting to just dump the body by the door. There was the faintest sliver of light, enough to see my arms and body but that was about it. I knelt down and placed Ginger down on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>&#39;Hope in the Dark&#39; is more relevant than ever</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-01-hope-in-the-dark-is-more-relevant-than-ever/" />
    <updated>2017-03-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-03-01-hope-in-the-dark-is-more-relevant-than-ever/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you are a woolly liberal like me, someone who believes in compassion for all and the importance of civil liberties, then these are dark times. The prevalent mood, both in the UK and the USA appears to be an inward turning nationalism, a conservative rhetoric that is looking backwards to some imagined age rather than forward to the future. There&#39;s an emphasis on military spending and reducing the state. The hard-won luxuries we enjoy, such as the NHS, are continually being eroded, while at the same time the super rich refuse to pay any more tax. The gap between the rich and poor is growing. Trump is in the White House, whereas in the UK we have the authoritarian Theresa May hell bent on sending the country over a cliff. It&#39;s easy to despair and hard to see any hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;That is why I am so thankful for Rebecca Solnit&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Hope in the Dark,&lt;/em&gt; which I came across via Josie Long on the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmicshambles.com/bookshambles&quot;&gt;Book Shambles &lt;/a&gt;podcast. It&#39;s a small volume, written in 2003 and updated since, but is even more relevant to the contemporary world we find ourselves in. Solnit is a brilliant activist and writer and she eloquently explores the necessity of hope when the world seems at it&#39;s worst. She tells a brief history of how the world has been changed in the last years, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together we are very powerful, and we have a seldom-told, seldom-remembered history of victories and transformations that can give us confidence that yes, we can change the world because we have many times before. You row forward looking back, and telling this history is part of helping people navigate toward the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this intricate history of social movements, it is essential reading for anyone despairing. Yes, times may be difficult now. Yes, there will be difficult challenges ahead. But Solnit argues that it is essential to keep looking at how far we have come as a society. Even since the book was written we have seen huge advances in LGBTQ rights, for example, to the point where allowing same-sex marriage became a no-brainer for most people, an essential cornerstone of a civilised society. The pace of change has been drastic and rapid, and by seeing the progress we have made we can look ever forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solnit also argues that although much activism doesn&#39;t have a clear end point, it nevertheless has an impact on thoughts and politics, often with surprising rapidity. She compares activism to the work happening backstage, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the inventive arenas that exert political power outside that stage or change the contents of the drama onstage. From the places that you have been instructed to ignore or rendered unable to see come the stories that change the world, and it is here that culture has the power to shape politics and ordinary people have the power to change the world.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is therefore an essential tool to change the world. It changes people&#39;s minds, slowly but surely. It&#39;s another reason to write or create art, as an act of defiance. You might not reach many people, but you never know what impact your work might have further down the road. Creation is essential to resist the lies and nonsense you are being fed everyday. You get the chance to tell a new story, one that is more inclusive and fairer. Art therefore becomes political.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, Solnit argues again and again that hope is not passive. She emphasises hope as an active desire to change things, seeing a better vision of the world and trying to bring it closer to reality. It&#39;s in the little actions throughout your life, in the journey to an unknown destination. Hope is the driving force that inspires great actions, not despair. Despair is passive, which is possibly why it is useful to keep people in their place. Hope, in contrast, allows you to get out the door and start to convince people. I&#39;ve struggled with this. I&#39;m a white, straight cis male. I am exceptionally privileged in every way. Solnit talks to this privilege and how it can limit us from taking action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then there were my people, middle-class white people. It was as though many of us didn’t know how to be this other kind of person, this person who could speak of big dreams, of high ideals, of deep emotions, as though something more small-scale and sarcastic was the reduced version of self that remained to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section spoke to me deeply. By having everything I needed, it has limited my vision and curbed my high ideals as I continually seek the middle ground. It&#39;s an emphasis on the self as well that can be so destructive, instead of what you can do for others. If anything good has come out of the car wreck of last year, it is the hope that people will be incensed and galvanised enough to take action and become activists. Indeed, I have become more political and willing to take action. People have realised that their rights and liberties are not guaranteed and can be taken away by the greedy and the opportunistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most inspiring proofs of this was the women&#39;s marches that occurred around the world immediately after Trump&#39;s inauguration. It was incredibly inspiring to see so many women marching for their rights, in defiance of Trump and his casual misogyny. The media reported it as a failure and as pointless because Trump didn&#39;t immediately resign. But that wasn&#39;t the aim. The aim was to plant the seeds of resistance that will carry us through the next few years and inspire us to action. As I watched so many women bravely defy the norm and march against injustice, I felt the faintest stirrings of hope, buried since Brexit. I thought of Solnit&#39;s description of the protests against the Iraq war:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those tens of millions worldwide constituted something unprecedented, one of the ruptures that have ushered in a new era. They are one reason to hope for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solnit writes much more eloquently than I ever could. This slim volume is essential reading for these times and I urge to read it. Her writing perfectly captures the urge to improve the world and to fight against all odds, no matter how high the obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>To Forbidden Passengers: Flash Fiction</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-22-to-forbidden-passengers/" />
    <updated>2017-02-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-22-to-forbidden-passengers/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wrote this from a Story prompt given by &lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2017/02/17/flash-fiction-challenge-ten-more-titles-round-two/&quot;&gt;Chuck Wendig&lt;/a&gt;, over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://terribleminds.com&quot;&gt;Terrible Minds &lt;/a&gt; I hope you enjoy!*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, congratulations. You have successfully made your way into the belly of the &lt;em&gt;Penumbra&lt;/em&gt;. The journey to this point has been difficult. I know, because I did it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless things have changed drastically since my time, it was a difficult path with many obstacles. I was almost discovered multiple times. I cannot believe I find myself in the hold of &lt;em&gt;Penumbra&lt;/em&gt;, on my way to a new destination across the void. I write this to you, Forbidden passengers like me and you, stowaways walking the path to the future, in the hope that you will hear my story and sympathise. You will need something to keep you occupied in the long weeks ahead. I think it is worth reflecting on how far you have come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you paid someone to transport you to the docking station. There are many unreliable guides. Most would have taken you to a random location, nowhere near the actual docking station. They would have taken you to an empty warehouse they claimed was the station, then left you to fend for yourself. Some would have taken you to the correct place, but tipped off the authorities at the same time. It is a double payday, getting our life savings as well as a bounty for hauling in the Forbidden. Our mere existence is a threat to them. Simply by breathing, we become the Forbidden. The penalties for smuggling us are high. The bounties are irresistible for many cowards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few disreputable guides are adverse to the risk but enjoy getting paid. They would have taken you outside the city, taken you beyond where the drones roam, waited for a quiet moment and shot you in the head. They would have left your bones to be picked clean by the wolves and vultures, your body rotting in a howling, empty field. These are the bad guides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose a good one. Clearly, so did you. I was lucky. I was well hidden and had the luxury of time to research my potential guides. I vetted them. I met with the man I chose twice and asked my questions carefully. I knew of the risks. There were friends that never reappeared. Many were blindly ignorant and put their trust in the first person who offered. As a rule of thumb, I am naturally suspicious. This world has honed that trait by scorning me and then casting me as Forbidden. It was a good survival trait. You will have similar traits. You have made it this far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the docking station, you somehow got past the full body scanners that cover the entrance. There are numerous tricks to confuse the sensors. Anti-heat pads, static jammers. I wonder which one you chose? It must have been ingenious because the authorities are continually updating the software to counter known threats. As you know, they will evaporate any of the Forbidden on sight. It is a painless way to go, I am told. Although there can never really be any empirical proof of that. How would they know? It could be the most painful moment of your short life. You have done well to avoid the scanners. I simply went over the top, crawling within the ceiling. It was dusty and the air was limited, but it was necessary. I imagine it has now been jammed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the scanners, you would have been lost in the maze of tunnels and corridors that make up the docking station. You would have kept your head down, avoiding the roaming cameras. You would have pressed yourself into the wall when necessary, blended in with the crowd at other times. You wouldn&#39;t have been able to ask anyone for help. If they had seen you, they might have realised you were Forbidden. Their faces would have fallen and they would have called the authorities. The authorities would have dragged you away for execution. So close but so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you probably had the route memorised, or else you would have stumbled around the docking station until you attracted attention, then got dragged off. Or else you would have lost yourself in the warrens of the corridors, maybe wandering lost for days. I knew the route off by heart, practised it for weeks until it was a part of my being. When it came to the port, I did not hesitate. I simply walked the route I knew so well, not deviating in the slightest. Nobody stopped me because I looked like I knew where I was going. My head was covered so no one knew I was Forbidden. I imagine you did something similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you got to the destination, the gate that held the &lt;em&gt;Penumbra&lt;/em&gt;, it would have been the most nerve-wracking part of the journey. One false move here and that would have been it. You needed to find a single member of the crew who met a specific description. You needed to make contact with them and pay then to smuggle you onto the ship, like some sort of contraband cargo. If you spoke to the wrong person, that was the end of it. I was told he had a brown beard and was called Sam. Of course, there were many people with brown beards milling around, but one specific person caught my eye. He was not moving around like the others, but staring straight at me, stood completely still. I took a deep breath and went up to him. It paid off. Clearly, it did for you too. It was the single most risky part for me because it was out of my hands. I trusted in fate or whatever you want to call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam agreed to transport me, and presumably you. He packed me into a crate and took me abroad. Now here I am, in the belly of the &lt;em&gt;Penumbra&lt;/em&gt;, waiting for the weeks to tick by. He has brought me food when I can, but the gaps in between have been long and the rations meagre. I am writing this by the small hold light, which as you will know is barely adequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all our present trials, dear Forbidden passenger, despite the pain and suffering we have undergone in getting to this dungeon, I wanted to give you heart. It was necessary to endure these difficulties because the alternative is too much to bear. They call us Forbidden. They deem we are not worthy of life. If they tell us that enough, we start to believe that our existence is not necessary. We start to believe we are inferior. That is not the case. We have been shunned for too long in this society. They remove our dignity and hunt us like scared animals. To be Forbidden is to exiled from the society you have lived in since you were born. To be Forbidden is to be denied the basic rights of humanity as everyone else. We cannot endure this. This is what you are leaving behind, dear fellow passenger. You may mourn your home, but it has not been yours for some time. They have taken that away from us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you and I have taken the risk. We have decided that the treatment of the Forbidden is cruel and unusual. We were not prepared to lie down and have our lives taken away from us. We have strived to escape our circumstances, to get to a place millions of miles away across the void where we can have the same rights as everyone else. We have resisted the categorisation as Forbidden and simply seen ourselves as living. We strive for freedom, like everyone else. It is a huge, brave journey we are on but it is the only way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am telling you this story because it is important to remember why we strive towards the stars. The journey is not yet over. There are weeks ahead in this small, cramped cargo bay. There will be limited food. You will have to pass security checks once you reach our destination. These will be unpleasant. There are several obstacles ahead. But it is better to die trying to escape than to lie down inert and useless. The journey is difficult but it is an essential one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take heart, Forbidden passenger. Many have done the journey before and many will follow. Once you reach our destination, you can hold your head high, breath in the air freely and shake off the label of Forbidden. For the first time, you can just be yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope these words give you comfort. Good luck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-A fellow traveller.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>George Saunders and Normalisation</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-08-george-saunders-and-normalisation/" />
    <updated>2017-02-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-08-george-saunders-and-normalisation/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In these days of increasing insanity in the world of politics, I find myself thinking more and more about the fiction of George Saunders. He understands that humans will adapt to any situation, however bizarre and will build their identities around it, even if that situation is horrifying. Many of his characters rebel against the situations, or come to the realisation that, like Brexit or Trump, this is not normal. Since I read &lt;em&gt;Tenth of December&lt;/em&gt; last year, the beautifully crafted short stories have become more and more relevant to the modern age. We seem to be living the surreal sci-fi world that Saunders created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoilers ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The main skill of Saunders is being able to get into his characters heads. The reader is forced to keep up with the stream of slang and situations which are normal to the characters but are strange to us. In &lt;em&gt;Escape from Spiderhead&lt;/em&gt;, we see things from Jeff&#39;s view as he is injected with multiple drugs. The opening disorientated us with its unusual slang and weird situations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absenti used his remote. My Mobipak™ whirred. Soon, the Interior Garden looked real nice. Everything seemed super clear. &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saunders manages to create a whole world from Jeff&#39;s perspective. Each sentence gives us new information about the character and the bizarre laboratory he finds himself it. By not providing direct exposition about the situation, Saunders forces us to learn about the world ourselves, seeing thing from Jeff&#39;s perspective. Jeff considers his reality, with its mindbending drugs that drastically affect his mood, to be completely normal. We don&#39;t know how he ended up in this position but we know he has been in it long enough to not think it unusual. The unthinkable has become reality and he has adapted directly to it. We see this again and again in Saunders fiction, where characters consider the most bizarre situations to be perfectly fine. They have adapted to the surreal nature of the world around them, even as the system has been bent rapidly out of shape. Humans are tenacious and able to normalise anything that comes their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more extreme is &lt;em&gt;The Semplica Girl Diaries&lt;/em&gt;, a horrific look at a society obsessed with class and status, to the detriment of other cultures. It starts so close to reality, with the protagonist writing in a diary about his struggles at work and at home. It&#39;s a character that many would sympathise with as he struggles to make ends meet. Later, the idea of the Semplica Girls is introduced, women from poorer countries who are hung with a wire through their brains in the garden. The wire goes through a special pathway and they swing, quite alive, as an ultimate status symbol for and affluent middle class. Saunder ramps up the uncomfortableness to the audience by making the main character completely alright with the situation. He is too concerned with status and providing for his kids. His young child, Eva, does have a problem with it though, seeing it as harmful and dangerous. He tries to explain it to her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point is, I said, everything relative. SGs have lived very different lives from us. Their lives brutal, harsh, uncompromising. What looks scary/Unpleasant to us may not be so scary/ unpleasant to them i.e., they have seen worse.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that justification, he can allow a whole host of horrors, displaying women as if they were trophies because their life might be worse elsewhere. Eva accepts this as an explanation for a time, but he has adapted completely to treating other human beings like objects. Society has justified the horrific treatment and the main character is simply trying to go along with it, trying to keep his place in the pecking order. He is too tired and too used to the system to question anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his stories though, Saunders shows basic humanity winning through. The characters reject what is normal in the society and rebel against it. In &lt;em&gt;Escape from Spiderhead&lt;/em&gt;, Jeff chooses to inject himself with a deadly drug, rather than harm another patient. In &lt;em&gt;The Semplica Girl Diaries&lt;/em&gt;, Eva cuts the Semplica girls down from the line and lets the women go free. Neither of these choices are easy and both have unintended consequences which Saunders does not shy away from. But the characters reject the normality of the society they live in and focus on the humanity and decency of their actions. Instead of causing harm to others as society expects, they try to cause the least harm. An inner morality wins out instead of the norms of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&#39;s why the stories have resonated with me over the past months. Our leaders are trying to change society and divide us further. They want to change what is normal, encouraging people to hate their neighbours based on some arbitrary distinction such as race, gender or sexuality. But like the characters in Saunders stories, we reject that. We know that humanity unites us, rather than divides us. That&#39;s why we need to be constantly reminded that this is not normal, so we don&#39;t get used to casual cruelty against others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Step Away from the Internet</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-02-step-away-from-the-internet/" />
    <updated>2017-02-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-02-02-step-away-from-the-internet/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every few months or so, an article comes around that reminds me I&#39;m spending too much time on the internet, looking at pointless things and wasting time. This time, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://backchannel.com/how-i-got-my-attention-back-c7fc9297d347#.ggm3ob4j1&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article by Craig Mod that caught my attention. It made me realise that I was once again endlessly flicking between the same sites, watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/davidralphlewis&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; refresh and reading the same articles over and over. It was an eloquently argued wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend a lot of time on the computer at work as well as when I&#39;m when writing. There&#39;s an internet connection constantly. If I&#39;m not on a computer, I have a tiny connected device in my pocket. The tech future of It&#39;s all too easy to jump onto Twitter or facebook, even just for a second. Craig talks about this in his article, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could live on Twitter all day, everyday, convincing myself I was being productive. Or, at least inducing the chemicals in the mind that make me feel like I’m being productive. Read more news. Send more replies. Start more threads. Each incoming reply activating a corresponding dopamine pop. Largely pushing nothing in the world forward.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a similar problem with constant access. I devour information, stories and facts and the internet is a constant stream that is hard to resist. A brief diversion to look up some details for a story can turn into an hour-long rabbit hole, where you end up miles away from you started. It&#39;s addictive in the simplest sense, you get knowledge as a reward for looking it up. It&#39;s a perfect Skinner box. I tend to lurk and read and absorb because by the time I think about responding there&#39;s something new, or someone else has made the same point only better. The net effect of this constant connectivity is a distracted mind and a lack of focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying the internet is a bad thing in the slightest. Technology has provided us with infinite information at our fingertips, which is great when you want to research a particular topic. It can also give you random connections between different things. If two unrelated items appear in a newsfeed, then I can start to make connections between them. In addition, the internet has also opened me up to ideas and information I would have no idea about otherwise. Music, films, books, the list goes on. There&#39;s a whole world of creators out there doing their thing for little recognition that I would never have heard of if it hadn&#39;t been for the internet. I can find people with similar interests and with opposing views and connect with them accros the globe. The connectivity has almost certainly changed my life for the better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, I have found, is that when it is time to concentrate I am distracted. It&#39;s increasingly hard to put my head down and focus on writing. The thoughts I have are sometimes undeveloped or truncated. Craig laments his lack of attention and I have encountered the same. It is a limited resource and by frittering it away on the many distractions of the internet, I lose a lot of it. Another problem is not being present or enjoying the moment. If I am constantly checking my phone for Instagram likes, then I am not engaging with the world around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think the answer is as extreme as disconnecting all the time. Craig does not advocate for this either, saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total disconnection is not only unsustainable for most people, but can also be an unnecessary act of self-sabotage.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I have deliberately carved out moments and hours where I am, for all intents and purposes, offline. I can usually still be called, or I may be using a computer and backing my work up to Dropbox, but that&#39;s about it. I certainly can&#39;t free roam around the internet as I usually do. A few months back I decided to disconnect completely on Sundays. Occasionally I break it, but I have mostly kept it up. I yearn for those days because they offer me a day of peace. I read, go for a walk and am hopefully more present in my time with Mel. It feels like an oasis at the end of the week. Since reading Craig&#39;s article, however, I have blocked off my phone in the mornings as well, using an &lt;a href=&quot;http://offtime.co/&quot;&gt;app&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve found it sets me up well for the rest of the day. In addition, I&#39;ve been trying to single task more and focus on what I&#39;m doing. All these small changes have added up and the last couple of weeks I have started to feel less scattered and have started to regain my attention span. It&#39;s hard work and by necessity, you need to be vigilant, but it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By disconnecting you allow your mind to breathe for creative work. If given space, your brain can think creatively. Most of my ideas come when I am away from the computer, usually swimming or washing up. I almost never have ideas when watching the feed refresh. Have space and allow yourself to be bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these days of constant streaming news and social media, it can feel overwhelming. There are too many options out there. With the stream of insanity coming from the news at the moment, it&#39;s hard to tear away. Since Brexit, then the election I have constantly been double checking the news. &lt;em&gt;What now?&lt;/em&gt; is my first thought. But it is important to step away from the constant torrent of madness, to allow your mind to calm and settle. It&#39;s necessary for your well-being and your sanity. Those in charge want you to be overwhelmed and scared because as the main character of Dune says &#39;Fear is the mind killer&#39;. I would argue that a lack of attention does the same thing. By feeding the dopamine monster, we reduce our attention span and become more vulnerable to manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d recommend disconnecting to anyone, but especially those trying to be creative. Carve out hours where you will not go on the computer or on your phone. Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wips.com/news/detail/31/block-site-work-and-don-t-be-disturbed&quot;&gt;blocking software&lt;/a&gt; if you have to. Whatever&#39;s necessary. Regain your time and in doing so, you regain space in your head.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alternative facts and the rule of misinformation</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-25-alternative-facts/" />
    <updated>2017-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-25-alternative-facts/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bloody hell, what a terrible phrase &#39;Alternative facts&#39; is. Similar to last years &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/&quot;&gt;post-truth&lt;/a&gt;&#39; that the UK media were so fond of last year, it seems the Americans are catching up to the Orwellian double-speak where 2+2 is 5 and nothing is as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;The story goes like this: The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said in his first conference that Trump&#39;s inauguration was watched by record numbers of people, in person and on TV. This, despite videos that prove the inauguration actually was one of the poorest attended in recent years. In a follow-up interview, an aide to Trump claimed he didn&#39;t lie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/22/politics/kellyanne-conway-alternative-facts/&quot;&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts.&amp;quot;. It has been widely ridiculed since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really, you can justify any position you want with that phrase. You don&#39;t need to tie it into reality. The mere fact of arguing becomes the justification. By removing your argument from the realm of facts, you can convince yourself of a position much easier. It&#39;s a terrible logical leap that allows you to believe anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake however, this is not an act of stupidity. The people using this language are very intelligent and at the top of their game, holding political power. It does not matter if people ridicule or mock their stance. Instead, it is a deliberate tactic to delegitimize other arguments against them, to strengthen their position and distract from what is actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is terrifying about the phrase is that it attacks the legitimacy of actual truth. If all truth is alternative, if all facts are malleable, then there is no consistent basis for argument. You can make anything up you like to and it doesn&#39;t need to have any basis in reality. You can say the sky is green and then argue it was just your opinion. The Trump team can say can say the inauguration was highly attended and the popular vote was rigged, despite no evidence whatsoever. It&#39;s why in the UK Theresa May is pushing for hard Brexit and saying that we will have a good chance of new trade deals. There is no basis for this, but we are living in a post-truth world so it doesn&#39;t matter about reality. The real world is over-rated anyway, with its inconvenient rules and restrictions. Much better to escape into a fantasy world, where you can argue and believe whatever you want. All those who disagree with you simply have the wrong set of facts.  Everything is true and false until you decide, one way or the other. It weakens the very foundation of rational debate because you attack the core facts and question their legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump and his team are not looking to see what is right or correct, but instead are appealing to feelings and gut instincts. The only problem is, your gut instinct can often be wrong and feelings are not reliable as a source of political information. But by attacking the concept of truth, they can raise questions in people&#39;s minds as to the reasons why people are criticising them. It is not because they are wrong, it is because the other side has an agenda, or are using reality against them. Any accusations or arguments against them can be dismissed as false because truth is no longer the currency between people. As such, they come out stronger because you have emotion on your side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also very useful as an arguing tactic to distract from everything else that is happening. Trump has started his presidency with the lowest approval &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/01/12/donald-trumps-approval-rating-lowest-president-elect-two-decades/&quot;&gt;rating &lt;/a&gt;of any president-elect. He is not a popular president and does not have the support of most of the country for the reforms he wants to introduce. By attacking the legitimacy of facts, the Republicans are able to distract attention away from what they are doing politically. Instead of attacking policy, the media and the public are distracted by arguing about whether the sky is green or what two plus two makes. It was a similar tactic Putin used during the invasion of Ukraine. Lie, lie and lie again, sometimes contradicting yourself until people don&#39;t know what is happening and spend forever trying to unpick the lies and establish some kind of truth. It becomes a smokescreen for the real actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few years are going to be full of this sort of bullshit. That&#39;s what these tactics are, bullshit. It&#39;s the lies of the con man trying to sell you a genuine &#39;Folex&#39;. It&#39;s only going to get worse as the Trump presidency tries to do what it likes, as Putin clings onto power and as here in the UK MP&#39;s try to sell losing trade and falling wages as a positive thing. We have to be vigilant in the coming years and focus on the facts, even if they are inconvenient for us or are against a deeply held belief. We like to think of ourselves as rational people, but we are subject every day to a whole host of biases and logical fallacies. We can&#39;t let leaders hide behind a smokescreen of alternative facts and post truth lies. We need to demand actual facts and figures, so we can focus on what&#39;s actually happening.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Press Conference</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-18-a-press-conference/" />
    <updated>2017-01-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-18-a-press-conference/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I am here today to announce there is nothing wrong. Nothing at all. Everything is fine. Rumours you may have heard to the contrary are simply that- rumours. Do not worry in the slightest. Do not worry about the Shadowlands. They do not exist because everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Look at this report. It is an official report, handed to me this morning from the Home Office. It investigates the probability of The Shadowlands existing. Underneath a section titled &#39;Do They exist?&#39;, there is simply a blank white space several pages long. Proof, if needed, that there is nothing currently wrong and The Shadowlands do not exist. Everything is fine. It&#39;s all here. Why would they leave a large blank space if there was nothing wrong? They wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s the job of the Home Office to tell the truth. They have made no mention of The Symptoms in the slightest, providing that they are idle gossip and fake news. It&#39;s dangerous to spread such malicious lies. Very dangerous indeed. We are publishing this report immediately and copies will be available for all the journalists gathered here. You will be able to read for yourself that everything is fine and those afflicted are merely experiencing mass hysteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d like to address the stories circulating in several publications, claiming to expose the truth about the Shadowlands and featuring interviews with several people with The Symptoms. These stories tell of shadows curling around the eyes, just at the edge of vision, leading to further, more intense Symptoms. This is made up. I&#39;d like to categorically state that I believe the stories to be lies and fabrications. A few isolated cases does not take away from the fact that everything is fine. We need to look at the bigger picture, which is there is no problem whatsoever. It is the belief of this government that The Symptoms do exist, but they are much more isolated than the media would have you believe. Indeed, we have only a couple of confirmed cases. People are scaremongering. Ask yourself who these reports come from? What are their motives? The majority of these sources are anti-government hacks, attempting to bring us down with dirty stories. People ideologically opposed to this government. They want to destroy the peace and stability of the world we have created by exposing potentially dangerous ideas about The Shadowlands. I am not saying The Symptoms do not exist. I am merely stating that the publication of these stories is irresponsible and will only cause panic. Everything is fine and that is the official line of this government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although isolated, the government would like to advise anyone experiencing The Symptoms to remain indoors. This is not a reason to panic. Everything is fine. It is simply that, as a precaution, it would be better to remain inside. It is advisable. Take some time to yourself. Watch television. Maybe play a computer game or read a book. Ignore the shadows creeping around the edges of your vision. If work calls, tell them the government instructed you not to go to work. Do not go to work. I repeat, do not go to work. This is very important. Everything is fine. Those with The Symptoms should also make themselves known to the authorities. This is so we can take good care of you and ensure that everything remains fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, nothing is wrong. This press conference is merely a formality. To clarify, there is no issue here. None whatsoever with The Shadowlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point to be made is The Shadowlands are not real. Sightings of them have been unconfirmed. Honestly, those reports on social media are pure fabrication.  It is not &#39;encroaching&#39; or taking over small villages. The village of Brilston was never there in the first place. Have you ever heard of it until this time? No. Of course you haven&#39;t. That is because the village has been made up out of thin air. The Shadowlands is not a real concern. It is a story, albeit a particularly viral one that has spread across social media. I refer to the earlier report by the Home Office. Everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, if there was such a thing as The Shadowlands, the government would be engaged in a secret war with them, hoping to stop the rapid spread of darkness falling across the land. Wanting to stop the shadows appearing in people&#39;s eyes. We would be working day and night to fight against it, despite not knowing what the enemy is, let alone how to combat it. There would be daily meetings of the crisis team as we would examine maps and regretfully shade out yet more areas. We would barely be able to sleep, kept up with those thoughts that creep into your head at 3am, that inevitable sense of panic, only tenfold. My God, we would think to ourselves, if only they knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is what we would be doing. But as I have categorically stated, there is no such thing as The Shadowlands so we are not doing that. There is nothing wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I would like to reassure you the Foreign Secretary is accounted for. She has not had The Symptoms, as some of the more scandalous reports have recently claimed. As I have said, The Shadowlands do not exist. She is merely taking a break from work due to medical reasons. That is why she has not been seen. Her replacement is taking over in the interim and is doing a sterling job. I will not put a timescale on her return. She will return to us when she is ready. To quell rumours before they start, of course she completed the report before she left. The blank pages are intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, everything is fine. The Symptoms are overhyped. The Shadowlands do not exist. Do not be afraid. We are your government and we are in complete control of the situation. Not that there is a situation. There is nothing wrong at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As everything is fine, there will be no questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Enduring art (Same as it ever was)</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-10-enduring-art-same-as-it-ever-was/" />
    <updated>2017-01-10T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-10-enduring-art-same-as-it-ever-was/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was listening to the rather excellent &lt;a href=&quot;http://cosmicgenome.com/shambles/&quot;&gt;Book Shambles &lt;/a&gt;podcast the other day. It is a rambling discussion about books and literature, usually with a guest to guide the discussion. One of the hosts, Robin Ince, mentioned &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;, saying that every time he reads it he finds new insight in its pages. It&#39;s my experience that despite being a relatively slim novella, the complex characters and removed perspective provides a wealth of wisdom and observations. It got me thinking about art that endures throughout your life, that helps to shape you at different moments. I think this is one of the qualities of the best art, that each time you go back to it it is richer and more in-depth than before. Re-readings and re-watchings allow for greater emotional impact, instead of diminishing returns. The art endures throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the reason I re-read &lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse 5&lt;/em&gt; by Kurt Vonnegut every couple of years of so. The first time I read it, I enjoyed it as a superficial time travel story, with some odd parts thrown in. There was some wit and some sadness but it didn&#39;t really hit me strongly. Re-reading it, it became a tragic tale of the human condition, showing the madness of killing each other senselessly through inhumane, mechanised wars. The time travel could be interpreted as part of Billy Pilgrim&#39;s broken mind, scarred by the horrors of war. The refrain &#39;So it goes&#39; becomes a grim full stop throughout the novel. The novel is a plea for humanity and hope in the grimmest of circumstances, as well as a furious rage against the direction of time&#39;s arrow. Despite being less than 200 pages, it is a deep, thoughtful work. Each time I read it I feel as if I have barely scratched the surface. I see new details and themes in it. As such, I regard it as one of the most influential works of art I have encountered. Enduring resonance is not the only criteria, but being able to experience it over again and find deeper meanings in the same piece of work is an important aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as revealing new details of the world around you, the best art reveals how we have changed in the meantime. The &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; films are the best examples of this I can think of. When you watch them as a child, they are fun adventures, filled with memorable characters and excitement. Watching as an adult though, the films take on a deeply melancholic air. All three tinged with sadness and there is an ongoing fear of abandonment that is absent when you watch them as a child. Watching the adventures of Buzz and Woody when you are older, you realise you have left behind your childhood years and lost your innocence. The ending of the third film, where Andy gives away the toys, is the most devastating part of the trilogy because of this theme that is only apparent when you are older. The art hasn&#39;t changed. No new scenes have been added. But watching as an adult, it seems to be a completely different film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#39;re always in flux. Always changing, year to year, day to day, moment to moment. Sometimes the changes are subtle. The days go by, then sometimes you wake up and say &#39;My God! What have I done?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wg1DNHbNU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok maybe not. But music is a good example of art that will endure over long stretches of time.  I must have first heard this song when I was 8 or so maybe. It has recurred throughout my life. I must have heard it thousands of times. Now as an adult, it has more meaning and significance. But the song itself has remained the same as it ever was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we change and grow in our lives, we bring different perspectives to the same works of art. We can see deeper meanings in it. We have learned more in the time between and had different events happen in our lives to alter our perceptions. We have changed as people, and the work of art allows us to see those changes. In the end, those significant works of art that we keep returning to are not the ones that have one off significance but that continue to resonate and allow for different interpretations throughout our lives. These are the ones that will guide our thoughts and experiences and have the greatest impact on our thinking, as they endure constantly in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A response to Laurie Gough</title>
    <link href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-04-a-response-to-laurie-gough/" />
    <updated>2017-01-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/posts/2017-01-04-a-response-to-laurie-gough/</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In another example of running a controversial story to get clicks, the Huffington Post published an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laurie-gough/selfpublishing-an-insult-_b_13606682.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by Laurie Gough that argues that self-publishing is an insult to the written word. (Of course, they also published &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/samita-sarkar/selfpublishing-an-insult-_1_b_13903202.html&quot;&gt;a reaction&lt;/a&gt; to the original article, so they have it both ways.) As a self-published author myself, I disagree with Laurie&#39;s argument. There has been a few angry responses to this opinion piece, but I thought I&#39;d offer some personal thoughts on why I take issue with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Self-publishing was the catalyst that enabled me to start making my writing more public. Before publishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/amberstars/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amber Stars: One Night of Stories&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;, I was very shy about what I shared. By forcing myself to get my work out there and available for criticism, it gave me confidence to write more. It is a strange little project of linked short stories, mostly stream of consciousness and I couldn&#39;t see a traditional publisher going for it. I was also frustrated by writing for years without completing anything and wanted to produce something tangible. As a result of getting it out into the world, I have been emboldened to write even more. Indeed, 2016 was my most productive year in terms of word count. I wrote a couple of drafts of a play, about twenty short stories, fifty or so blog posts, a load of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/rediscovering-poetry/&quot;&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; and a whole stack of journals. If I hadn&#39;t self-published my first book, I doubt I would have been this productive. The positive feedback from &lt;em&gt;Amber Stars&lt;/em&gt; meant I felt more confident to continue to share my work. Later in the year I even self-published another book, a play script called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/remain-vigilant/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Remain Vigilant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. None of this would have happened without the tools of self-publishing. I was in control because I looked after the means of production, the distribution, the rights and the promotion. It hasn&#39;t sold as well as a traditionally published book, but I never expected it to. The whole point was to get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laurie has some genuinely good advice buried under all the controversy. She says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good writers only become good because they’ve undertaken an apprenticeship. The craft of writing is a life’s work. It takes at least a decade to become a decent writer, tens of thousands of hours&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree with this 100%. Any creative art form is a long slog. It takes constant practice, years of honing and lots of work. But you need encouragement to stick with it. Otherwise you may not get to the point of continuing to still write after the ten years. You may have given up long before. Self-publishing offers an alternative to being rejected by publishers that may not want your book because it doesn&#39;t fit their market. You can still sell paintings by yourself without hanging them in a gallery. You can sing for years in clubs or bands without having a CD published by a major label. Neither of these means you are any less of an artist, nor does it diminish your &#39;apprenticeship&#39;. The same goes for writing. If you want to self-publish then you have the tools and you can call yourself a writer. It doesn&#39;t mean your book will be any good, constant practice will do that. By publishing yourself, you are able to get feedback, build a platform and grow as an artist. Your future work, which can be the mythical good writing that Laurie desires, will be built on the back of your previous books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the article, Laurie argues for the harm this openness causes to writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the firestorm of self-published books unleashed on the world, I fear that writing itself is becoming devalued.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except it&#39;s not diminishing anything. I would argue that writing is more valued in today&#39;s world, just in different forms. The pie only grows the more people get involved. Self-publishing is not reducing the impact of other books. It is creating a larger audience for all types of work. We are lucky to live in an age where the internet has enabled the democratisation of art. So many different artists are able to produce new and interesting work and as such it allows a platform for voices that may not have been heard. Instead of diminishing the written word, it enriches and enhances it by offering many different perspectives that will feed into future work. Sure, it also offers more competition, but again this is a good thing, as it forces authors to work harder to sell more books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you dislike self-published works, that&#39;s fine. You don&#39;t have to read them. It&#39;s not necessary to see it as a sign of impending doom for the art form.  You are fine to safely ignore any book that is not published under a traditional imprint. There is room for every approach. Self-publishing is simply another avenue that authors have to explore. It has worked wonders for me, but it may not necessarily be for you. That doesn&#39;t mean the sky is falling on publishers or on writing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

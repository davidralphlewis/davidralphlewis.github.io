<p>I've made this book free, see download links below.</p>
<p> A small micropamphlet of poetry  made during lockdown, when I was missing the sea. I self-published it in a limited physical run in October 2020.</p>
<p> It features ten poems about swimming and the peace I find immersing myself in water. (There is another, secret meaning; trying to find moments of calm in a relentless, chaotic world.)</p>
<p><s>You can buy a physical copy at <a href="https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com">my shop</a> for Â£3 (only a couple left.)</s> Now sold out!</p>
<p>Or you can download it as a PDF for free. It's released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License</a>, so please share, remix, add or alter it if you want. It's yours.</p>

<p> If you want to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis">buy me a coffee</a> it would be much appreciated, but is by no means essential.</p>

    <h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Larger things I have out in the world. Most of the books are available for free download. No email address or anything required, just click through</p>
<h2>Short Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/amberstars/">Amber Stars: One Night of Stories</a> is the first book of short stories I wrote, all set in one night in a small town. Free download.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Poetry</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="/ourvoicesinthechaos/">Our Voice in the Chaos</a> was my first pamphlet originally published by <em>Selcouth Station</em>, mixing blackout poetry and normal poetry to show the collapse of society. Free download.</li>
<li><a href="/spareparts/">Spare Parts</a> was a collaboration with M. Amelia Eilki. She wrote flash fiction and I created blackout poetry from it.</li>
<li><a href="/refractionpamphlet/">Refraction</a> is a micro pamphlet about swimming. Free download.</li>
<li><a href="/reality-adjustments/">Reality Adjustments</a> A small interactive poetry pamphlet written in TWINE, about a city that is always changing. Free to play <a href="https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments">here.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/product/emergence">Emergence</a>- A poetry pamphlet based around the idea of panpsychicism, or consciousness as an emergent property of the universe. An excuse to mess around with form. Still got a few left, link takes you to the shop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mini Zines</h2>
<p>I've made a few little zines as a way of making something from poems.</p>

<li><a href="/assets/books/imperfect-zine.pdf">How not to make things perfectly</a> - (Direct pdf download) - A very quick zine about making things quickly. More details and the text of the zine <a href="/posts/how-not-to-make-things-perfectly/">here.</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/books/g-man-zine.pdf">G Man</a> (Direct pdf download) - Weird poem about an ancient pagan deity being tortured by a shadowy government agency. I like performing this one.</li>
<li><a href="/assets/books/Poetry-Dice-Zine.pdf">Poetry Dice Zine</a> (Direct pdf download) - Zine about making poems from dice rolls as a quick warm up exercise. Post is <a href="/posts/2024-06-22-quick-dice-poetry-exercise/">here</a></li>
<li><a href="/assets/books/quota-zine.pdf">Quota</a> (Direct pdf download) - Another weird poem, this time about climate change. Made with rubber stamps and red ink.</li>
<li><a href="/assets/books/serenity-study-zine.pdf">Serenity Study</a>- Old zine I made during the pandemic. About things that bring me peace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Plays</h2>

    <h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm a poet and short story writer based in the south west of the UK, who writes surreal and imagistic work. I mess around with words and self publish, both here and in real life. I also perform as a spoken word artist, haunting open mics with my nonsense.</p>
<p>My writing has appeared in <em>Neon Magazine</em>, <em>Nine Muses Poetry</em> and <em>Marble Poetry</em>.</p>
<p>This website has all my writings and my books. It's a little broken at the moment as I change from Jekyll to Eleventy. Haven't got pictures working for example. Oh well, we will get there</p>
<p>It has a blog I've been maintaining for 8 years. Subjects include art, politics, poems and anything else I fancy.</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/now">Here</a> is what I'm up to now.</p>

<p>Dark of course, but dancing shades<br>
that lap and swirl and churn and roil.<br>
Her eyes have depths she did not realise.<br>
No sound but the slap, clap<br>
of the metal hull bracing, leaping.</p>

<p>Soon, they joined together in hordes<br>
of increasing size, shudders running over<br>
their bodies like waves in a storm.<br>
They sat together over the cenotaph,<br>
the shopping centre, spilled out into two<br>
lane roads, holding each other as their sobs<br>
became life rafts. Confused crowds watched,<br>
unwilling to leap over to understanding.<br>
Soon traffic stopped altogether, drivers<br>
unable to see through salt water.</p>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/">creativity and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I'd write up the process in case it's useful for anyone else.</p>

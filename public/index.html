    <h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>I'm a poet and short story writer based in the south west of the UK, who writes surreal and imagistic work. I mess around with words and self publish, both here and in real life. I also perform as a spoken word artist, haunting open mics with my nonsense.</p>
<p>My writing has appeared in <em>Neon Magazine</em>, <em>Nine Muses Poetry</em> and <em>Marble Poetry</em>.</p>
<p>This website has all my writings and my books. It also has a blog I've been maintaining for 8 years. Subjects include art, politics, poems and anything else I fancy.</p>
<p><a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/now">Here</a> is what I'm up to now.</p>

<p>When I wrote about <a href="/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/">creativity and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I'd write up the process in case it's useful for anyone else.</p>

<p>Streets now sliced streaks of<br>
shimmering turquoise, scarlet and<br>
funeral grey blurs, suggestions of<br>
doors, signs and windows barely<br>
registering. How long, running for a<br>
lifetime? No wheezes, no stitches, no<br>
sweat. Pavement treadmills, that<br>
red car ahead suspended in<br>
motion. I need to catch up. Why? No<br>
time for questions. Legs now<br>
pistons, push my hazy memory of a<br>
body forever forward as the city<br>
loops over again towards the<br>
vanishing point, never reached â€”</p>

<p>For the last few years, I've been playing <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> as a Dungeon Master. This is the person who creates the world and encounters for the players to explore. Every session is fun and I enjoy inventing increasingly strange situations for the party to react to.</p>

<p>I have been unable to describe the shape<br>
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning<br>
for our forgotten winter in a language<br>
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky<br>
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,<br>
orange markers bleeding through the page.<br>
My garden whispers like a fading dream<br>
as thoughts transmute to smoke,<br>
wisp and separate and float. Recently</p>

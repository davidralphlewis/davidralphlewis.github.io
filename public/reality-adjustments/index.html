<p>A small interactive poetry pamphlet written in TWINE, about a city that is always changing. Pick your way through flickering walls and ever mutating streets. Wait for an apocalypse, go to a hidden bar or get a random job.</p>
<p>Multiple paths and endings transform what has gone before. Paths loop back around themselves leading to hidden corners. Didn't you come this way before? Wasn't this street different when you last walked down it?</p>

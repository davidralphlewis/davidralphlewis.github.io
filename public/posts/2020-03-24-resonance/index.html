<p>I joined a Facebook group [^1] which has daily prompts. This one was written in response to the prompt: &quot;How do you click: Write a poem filled with noise&quot; poem.</p>
<p>It's the first day of lockdown, a week of social distancing and I feel this is representative of me missing the buzz and hum of humans in general.</p>
<h2>Resonance</h2>
<p>Days pass with the click of keys,<br>
the confused mumblings of the wind,<br>
unseen neighbours speaking, phrases<br>
occasionally diffusing through walls.</p>
<p>Underneath, I still hear an echo-<br>
many voices merged into a chorus.<br>
We were so melodic, weren't we?<br>
We sang in such rare harmonies.</p>
<p>Our vibrations still shake each<br>
single brick, rumble along tarmac,<br>
and cause dust to dance with joy.<br>
Holding my breath, I listen.</p>
<p>[^1]: Poetry in the time of being alone.</p>

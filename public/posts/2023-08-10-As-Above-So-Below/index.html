<h2>0.2</h2>
<p>Mud as a river. Mud as a theoretical concept, the transistory state of matter rarely glimpsed. Mud described in complex equations. Mud as the consequence of our actions we refuse to acknowledge or take responsibility for, despite it chewing at our shins. Mud in our boots. Mud in our hair. Mud clogging up our pores so we sweat mud. Mud turning our hills to waterslides. Mud washing away our temporary shelters. Mud as a non-Newtonian fluid we can bounce across if we hit it hard enough. Mud as the inevitable future. Mud as penance. Mud as the herald, the herald of the flood.</p>
<h2>0.6</h2>
<p>Technical difficulties-<br>
Oh.<br>
Maybe if I-<br>
Oh.<br>
Or perhaps-<br>
Oh.<br>
Could you-<br>
Oh.</p>
<h2>1.1</h2>
<p>Ice receedes like a hairline,<br>
little at first then all at once.<br>
The problem lies beneath the skin,<br>
down under a mile of compressed blue,<br>
where strange bodies skitter and wriggle.
where pressure will implode careless bones.<br>
Down there, in the dark, it is warmer.<br>
Only by a degree. But pressure and salinity<br>
are poorly understood and difficult to model.<br>
And there, unnoticed by passing survey ships<br>
or penguins, tunnels are being carved<br>
into the glacier like delicate incisions,<br>
bringing warmer water to what lies above.</p>
<h2>1.7</h2>
<p>The gulf stream splutters,<br>
croons to us like a drunk -<br>
croaking, hoarse.</p>
<p>We are held captive<br>
by its sporading warbling<br>
feel its hot breath<br>
rattling.</p>
<h2>2.5</h2>
<p>Just two morals before Rishi Sunak<br>
opened hundreds of lifespans<br>
for ommission and gasket extravagance<br>
in the north sea, an IT fishmonger<br>
founded by his fault-in-law<br>
signed a 1.5 billion binge death<br>
with enigma guilt BP.</p>
<h2>3.2</h2>
<p>I stand vulnerable under artifical rain,<br>
enjoying the luxury of not reading headlines.</p>
<p>I count everything I know for certain,<br>
Watch it swirl and vanish down the drain.</p>
<h2>4.0</h2>
<p>On the surface of this new lake<br>
hundreds of worms rejoice,<br>
then as water keeps cascading,<br>
twitch as one, stop moving.</p>

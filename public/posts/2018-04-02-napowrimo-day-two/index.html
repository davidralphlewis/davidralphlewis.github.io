<h2>Grey</h2>
<p>He lived his days in monochrome;<br>
grey suit, white shirt, grey tie,<br>
bought in bulk to avoid choice.</p>
<p>At home he watched silent films,<br>
ate powdered mash and white bread,<br>
nothing with too much flavour.</p>
<p>He always yearned for cloudy days,<br>
when detail was muted. Those times<br>
his heart soared, but not too high.</p>
<p>He watched the days disappear,<br>
passing him by like raindrops<br>
sliding down a car window.</p>
<p>They found him on his grey sheets.<br>
A smile, for the first time, on his face<br>
which had turned as grey as granite.</p>

<p>This was written in a slow single waltz<br>
before the next one</p>
<p>This morning I feel like a strange conversation<br>
with the discomfort of my head<br>
and the contact of your language is a way to make sure<br>
This morning is the first time I've been maintaining the water<br>
finally and the seed is going to go with your advice<br>
This morning I have a refund for my part time job in London<br>
and I have been told that the rhythm of your language
is a better man than I</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These days are the hardest things to get in the way</p>
<p>I have been sent over the page<br>
for your time and consideration<br>
I have been my phone with you today<br>
but I'll have another go<br>
I have left the email this morning<br>
and I become aware of my body<br>
I am currently based in the world today<br>
but I have been sent over to the horizon<br>
I once again apologise for the inconvenience caused by<br>
viruses but we must have been told that we deserve the<br>
world to be able to deliver</p>
<p>You have been many years of limbo<br>
and I have been sent over to you<br>
You have been told that I will be a satisfying answer<br>
You want to be liked and then<br>
you will know what reality is<br>
You are well aware that I am not going anywhere</p>
<p>These days have been told that I will be necessary for the wind<br>
These mornings are ideal for the first time</p>
<p>You are a number of people who are infinite</p>

<p>This was a prompt from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/">Bristol Tonic</a>. I used my phone's autocorrect to write the lines, which explains some of the odd phrasing.</p>

<p>What good is this scattering over the grass,<br>
this gold and white confetti, these eyes<br>
opening at dawn and closing in the twilight?<br>
These are Freya's flowers and she is welcome<br>
to them. We have no use for blooms. Callous gods,<br>
you cannot substitute one beauty for another.<br>
What help is protection now? Your garlands<br>
are mere distractions, we have no desire<br>
to chew on the pollen, fill our mouths<br>
with bitter medicine. Left long enough<br>
the petals blister our skin, we become<br>
sun scaled. Spread them no more, perpetual<br>
reminders of our sorrows that raise their<br>
heads above the green then proliferate<br>
over the fields. They will never bring<br>
back those who have sunk below, those now<br>
cradled by the waiting arms of roots.</p>
<p>No, bring us only those yellow weeds,<br>
the ones considered ugly and overlooked.<br>
We will mash up the leaves and boil them<br>
into a tea to calm our racing hearts,<br>
make a balm to smooth our scarred skin<br>
and calm our sadness. We can chop up the<br>
roots to make us more alert. We will leave a<br>
handful to transform into spheres of cloud,<br>
which we will use to tell the time, helped<br>
sometimes by indifferent winds. In this<br>
hungry gap of spring we will feast on<br>
what we find beneath the hedgerows or<br>
reaching through the borders of beds. We reject<br>
your funeral wreathes of daisies, your<br>
meaningless gestures of fragile beauty.<br>
Bring us dandelions so we may live.</p>

This poem was written from a prompt by the wonderful [Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic) for their second birthday. Everyone got the same prompt 'Daisies and Dandelions'
<p>I was also lucky enough to have it played on BBC Radio Bristol on their Upload show. It's on BBC Sounds until the end of the month, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p08f8bh7">find it here</a>, at 1 hour 48 mins.</p>
<p>I've uploaded the original audio to Soundcloud. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/davidralphlewis/condolences">Listen here</a></p>
<p>UDPATE: Charlie and Jake also did an amazing version with music as part of their Echoes and Edges livestream. See below:</p>

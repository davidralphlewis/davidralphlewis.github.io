<p>and yes, I still gathered branches,<br>
and yes, I still wore my woollen coat,<br>
but it was unbuttoned, no scarf</p>
<p>and yes, my skin still raised in surprise,<br>
and yes, the sky still heralded rain,<br>
but the sun was a paintbrush, not a scalpel</p>
<p>and yes, many branches were still bare<br>
but tight buds were gently unspooling<br>
and the grass rioted in damson and mustard</p>
<p>and yes, warmer and more expansive days<br>
were diving towards me on golden wings</p>

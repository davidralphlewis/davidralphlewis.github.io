<p>When I wrote about <a href="/creativity-lessons-from-dnd/">creativity and <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em></a>, I mentioned I had adapted roll tables to create a random poetry prompt. I thought I'd write up the process in case it's useful for anyone else.</p>
<p>I got this idea from <a href="https://www.roleplayingtips.com/gm-books/tiny-prep/"><em>Tiny Prep</em></a>, which is a way to create dungeons by rolling dice. You leave the decisions of creativity up to chance and it helps you start writing without judgement.</p>
<p>This exercise is meant to be quick, no more than 5 minutes. You just need two standard dice (d6).</p>
<p>First pick a prompt. Roll a dice and write about:</p>
<ol>
<li>A memory</li>
<li>What you can currently sense (see, hear, feel, taste)</li>
<li>A random word (generators like <a href="https://randomwordgenerator.com/">this</a> are useful.)</li>
<li>A random photo</li>
<li>Open a book at a random page and choose a phrase at random.[^1]</li>
<li>A headline from a magazine or newspaper</li>
</ol>
<p>You can set a timer for five minutes and free write to this prompt to see what comes up, or you can try to restrain it further. Recently I've been rolling a second dice to guide the type and form of writing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write a haiku</li>
<li>Write a tanka</li>
<li>Write a cinquain</li>
<li>Write a sestet</li>
<li>Write a vivid description, using as much detail as possible</li>
<li>Free write</li>
</ol>
<p>You could also roll another dice to set the time if you want. Can you write a sestet in a minute? Genuine question as I have no idea!</p>
<p>I find this exercise gives me a good starting point for a poem, something I can build on and adapt. Hope it helps you start some poems.</p>
<p>[^1]: This is known as bibliomancy</p>

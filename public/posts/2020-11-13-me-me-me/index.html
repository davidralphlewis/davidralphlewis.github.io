<p>I've been lucky to get lots of stuff out in various places so this is a collection of links to my words elsewhere on the internets:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I have three poems in <a href="https://www.neonmagazine.co.uk/neon-literary-magazine-issue-51/">the latest issue</a> of <em>Neon Magazine.</em> One is about parallel universes, one is about a comet and the other is about a potential future. Neon was one of the first literary magazines I read, so it's a real honour to be included in this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The Daily Drunk Magazine</em> published a very silly poem of mine called <em>Advertorial.</em> It was the quickest acceptance I've ever had. Find it <a href="https://thedailydrunk.com/f/advertorial">here.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Poems to keep you company</em> is a lovely newsletter ran by <a href="https://www.samjgrudgings.co.uk/poems-to-keep-you-company">Sam J. Grudgings</a> that he is restarting for the second lockdown. I have a small poem of hope in it and there's also a recipe and other wonderful poets within it. Check it <a href="https://c675fb33-c09e-4bc2-9288-75c791da753d.filesusr.com/ugd/149b1f_8498dd2f4fd7478fa39e3a6476d7dcb4.pdf">out here.</a></p>
</li>

<p>Hey remember when we used to gather together in person to share art and forge connection? Me neither. But I finally published a live performance from <a href="facebook.com/BristolTonic/">Bristol Tonic</a> that's been sat in my drafts for six months. This is &quot;Thinking other people's thoughts&quot; and is a bit silly.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Lots of plans bubbling away at the moment so more news as and when I get it. Stay safe and well everyone.</p>

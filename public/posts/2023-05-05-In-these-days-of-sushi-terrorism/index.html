<p>second hand bright ghosts collide,<br>
lighting up our motorways in sparks<br>
of emerald and indigo. Disruption<br>
in the supply chain is our mantra,<br>
repeated often to become meaningless.<br>
Fish is mostly off the menu now<br>
hidden currents flourish incandescent.<br>
I barely think about my death machine<br>
despite piloting it twice daily.<br>
Watched by an arrogant pigeon,<br>
I flex my fingers, ready to push<br>
the correct button at the correct time.<br>
I have trained for this all my life.</p>
<p>An email arrives with a cruel squawk:<br>
'Do your best. Fire is still needed.<br>
Please answer these questions asap:</p>
<ol>
<li>How many sunflower seeds would replace your body?</li>
<li>How long until cargo containers become sentient?</li>
<li>What government mandated checks must you perform on each wasabi packet?'</li>
</ol>
<p>I throw another spectral log into the hearth<br>
watch it flicker like growing grass.</p>

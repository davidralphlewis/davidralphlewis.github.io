<h2>Unwritten</h2>
<p>I had been sleeping in segments<br>
like an essay you can't concentrate on<br>
and write in sloppy short paragraphs<br>
before stopping. I was inbetween waking<br>
and dreaming most days, half asleep<br>
in the day, half awake at night.</p>
<p>That one night I must have been asleep<br>
although I felt wide awake and wired.<br>
My vision was engulfed in brightness;<br>
beautiful vision of shock and awe,<br>
hideous in its consuming beauty.<br>
I knew, instinctively, like pulling<br>
your hand from the fire, this was<br>
a Being five dimensions removed<br>
from my pathetic flesh and thought,<br>
constructed from the light beyond sight.</p>
<p>Strange movements amongst the beams,<br>
shades and patterns dancing over me,<br>
a language I now cannot comprehend<br>
but at the time I understood as words.<br>
In my fugue state, a poem was dictated,<br>
verses that contained the answers to<br>
every question, the meaning of time<br>
and the rhythms and lines that could<br>
set a universe into joyous motion.<br>
I wept to hear it. I swore I would be<br>
its unworthy terrestrial messenger.</p>
<p>I woke, for certain this time, lost in<br>
the hours before the world stirred.<br>
Searching for a pen, I already felt the words<br>
pour out of my memory, like sand grains<br>
through an open palm. When I finally<br>
located a chewed biro, my head was empty.</p>
<p>I was left shivering and half awake,<br>
unsure of why I was gripping a pen,<br>
unsure of the time or my location<br>
unsure even of who or what I was.</p>
<p>The dawn chorus had erased the divine</p>

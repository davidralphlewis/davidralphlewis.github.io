<!-- /wp:heading -->  
<p>One time, he marched down six flights<br />then, panting, demanded the manager, <br />argued his way into a room change. Any other<br />number would do, would keep him safe,<br />but those digits were cursed. He wouldn't<br />even walk in. He never stepped on pavement<br />cracks despite his mother turning to dust, <br />burnt sage and rosemary to cleanse the spirits<br />from his flat built in the eighties, <br />was always polite to magpies. In this way,<br />the unknown was kept in fierce control.<br />Life continued to intrude, long and<br />yet brief. He would not like this small poem. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

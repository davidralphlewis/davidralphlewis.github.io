<h2>Faster Than Light</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  
<p>Let us wander around the symmetry<br /> and geometry of narrow alleys<br /> that shift around us as we meet<br /> ourselves walking towards us<br /> smiling as we will do soon.</p>  
<p>Streets flicker. Buildings are destroyed<br />  
then rubble flies upwards and they are<br />  
newly constructed. The moon slams into<br />  
the welcoming ocean and the planet grows.<br />  
Somewhere we are briefly under stars.</p>  
<p>It's hard to see anything when<br />  
we bend the light around us,<br />  
cocoon ourselves in the silence<br />  
beyond possibility as our bodies<br />  
bruise and age and grow younger.</p>  
<p>I smile and say goodbye then<br />  
we meet. I am walking away and <br />  
saying hello while you stand still<br />  
but already you cross the street<br />  
to shake my hand once again.</p>  
<p>Hours become dropped slides<br />  
out of sequence, corrupted videos<br />  
playing at random. Time was always<br />  
optional, causality was always<br />  
a sweet lie to keep us sane.</p>  
<p>At some point we reach an edge<br />  
or so we think. We bend backwards<br />  
finding our weary feet at the start<br />  
having not moved an inch. Odysseus<br />  
is always leaving and arriving at Ithaca.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

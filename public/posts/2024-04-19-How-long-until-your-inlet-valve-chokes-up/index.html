<p>with lint and grime? Oil seeps into every<br>
exposed surface, delays the build up of rust,<br>
but decline is inevitable. When did you last<br>
consider your camshaft bearing, your crankshaft<br>
drillings, your line shaft? You forgot to follow<br>
the established maintenance schedule,<br>
didn't you? Made a checklist then delayed<br>
consulting it. Eventually, your pistons<br>
will stop pumping, a spark plug will fail,<br>
your alternator will burn out or a wire<br>
to your battery will fray. How much grease<br>
lines the walls of your intake manifold?<br>
Is it enough? When did a professional<br>
last give you a look over? Your catalytic<br>
convertor is clogged, you are speaking<br>
in toxic fumes. How long has your engine<br>
management light been flashing on and off?</p>

<p>We've done everything we possibly can<br>
they proclaim on nightly broadcasts,<br>
shaking their fists for emphasis as if<br>
describing ineffective ancient magic<br>
runes in the air, as globs of engine oil<br>
dribble down their chins, distracting<br>
from the soft focus, where shadows<br>
tear copper wire from the concrete.</p>
<p>We've done all we can, they inisist<br>
in their two thousand pound a piece<br>
newspaper columns, before huffing<br>
furniture polish, snorting ground<br>
rare turtle eggs and sitting down<br>
to a subsidised pre-luncheon of<br>
flammable cladding shavings over<br>
satueed arms deals and steamed<br>
dreams. They ask the staff to turn<br>
up the music, block out the sirens,<br>
the near constant rise and fall<br>
from cold streets, indistinguishable<br>
from the wails of hungry children.</p>
<p>We've simply done everything we can<br>
they proclaim, whilst frantically<br>
issuing bills, edits and emergency<br>
agreements that say nothing at all.<br>
We stop listening, but aren't surprised<br>
when we find our mostly methane river<br>
catching fire on hot days, feel rain<br>
of razor blades fall over our naked<br>
flesh, run our taps for some water,<br>
watch our sinks bubble and corrode.</p>
<p>Listen, we've done everything we can,<br>
they plead on billboards and radio<br>
interviews, while filling their pockets<br>
with piles of precious gems and futures,<br>
flinging contracts at any incorporated<br>
friend, sealing themselves in airtight<br>
packaging, posting themselves first class<br>
to their isolated third homes (the ones<br>
that are registered to their daughters<br>
for tax reasons you understand), while<br>
a hundred thousand pairs of eyes<br>
filled with ash and soil, look on</p>
<p>unblinking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Less a poem and more a rant, this has been circling in my mind since last week. I hope it will be less relevant in time.</p>

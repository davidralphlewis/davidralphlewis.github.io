<p>For the month of April, I have tried to write a poem a day for <a href="http://www.napowrimo.net/">NaPoWriMo</a> (National Poetry Writing Month.) It's been surprisingly difficult to find a different theme or story each day. Nevertheless, I feel the process has pushed me forward as a writer by sending me into unknown areas. It's giving me much needed rigour and discipline. I consider myself to be an amateur, with less experience in poetry than in <a href="/amberstars/">short stories</a> or plays. I only started writing poetry again <a href="/rediscovering-poetry/">last year</a>, and even then it was fairly occasional. Forcing myself to write a poem a day has been a boon, as I have tried to improve each day.</p>
<p>I haven't shared all of them because I feel most are fairly poor and in need of serious editing. However, here are a few. This first one was written early in the process:</p>

<h2>#Nofilter</h2>  
<p>Finally, I reach this summit after<br>
Hauling my bag of bones and fat<br>
Up the slope, I see magnificence.<br>
A rolling vista of plenty spread before<br>
My weary eyes, perfectly lit by the<br>
Rotating earth and the apparently sinking<br>
Sun. I take a picture of course.</p>
<p>Surely, this a glimpse of the infinite.<br>
I am staggered by-<br>
Oh, a couple of retweets and a like.<br>
Staggered by the view, by the simple act o<br>
of living and-<br>
Heh.<br>
That reply is actually quite funny.<br>
Nature in all its majesty is-<br>
Oh a couple of likes on Instagram as well.<br>
Cool.<br>
That thread on Twitter is still going.<br>
I find the perfect meme<br>
Reply back.<br>
Back to Instagram while I wait, maybe Facebook<br>
although Facebook is dead, no one is using Facebook anymore, why are you on Facebook? I check it anyway, just to see. Nothing of course.<br>
Back to Twitter one last time. Nah, Nothing.<br>
Wait<br>
Nothing.</p>
<p>I tear my eyes away from the feed<br>
To see hills darkening<br>
And a wind starting to whisper<br>
Bringing with it the promise of ruin.</p>
<hr />  
<p>This next one was written on the 10th.</p>
<h2>Opacity</h2>  
<p>You stalk the streets, a shadow<br>
hunting for a solid object to link to.<br>
You haunt dimly-lit coffee shops,<br>
wondering if you have been downgraded<br>
from translucent to invisible.</p>
<p>There is the bitter taste of ashes<br>
on your tongue. You avoid street<br>
lamps, not wanting the light to burn<br>
away your essence. You are awake</p>
<p>At half three in an unknown part<br>
of this strange city, far away from home.<br>
You are avoiding eye contact. You are<br>
walking. Why are you walking?<br>
Where are you going?</p>
<p>You are swaying in flourescent churches<br>
with little memory of the journey.<br>
You are waiting for the dawn<br>
Although you know it will evaporate you<br>
like dew from a leaf. You wonder<br>
how to spend your cursed seconds.</p>
<p>I will wait with you,<br>
Sit with me.</p>
<hr />  
<p>This last one was written today.</p>
<h2>Coverings over bones</h2>  
<p>Casually discarded at the bottom<br>
of the dark cave wardrobe, creased<br>
into a ball by time and worn by<br>
pressure and clothes above,<br>
you find an ancient relic of a jumper.</p>
<p>Flour is still caked on the sleeve.<br>
It was meant to be washed years<br>
ago, but slipped through the cracks<br>
of minutes, sunk through the soil<br>
of days.</p>
<p>Run your fingers over<br>
the deep creases, the frayed sleeve<br>
that your thumb always hooked in<br>
the hole under the armpit<br>
you always meant to fix.</p>
<p>Exhumed, it releases to the surface<br>
a memory of making bread, the taste<br>
long forgotten; lazy Sunday afternoons<br>
and the faintest history of the person<br>
you always yearned to be.</p>
<hr />  
<p>It's a fun challenge and even if the poetry is no good, I've enjoyed pushing myself into a new area of writing. I'll share some more once April is up.</p>

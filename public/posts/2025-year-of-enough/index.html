<p>Instead of setting new year's resolutions, I'm a big fan of setting a theme for the year. This is inspired by a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">C G P Grey</a>. A couple of years ago was the year of slow, last year was the year of connection and this year is going to be the year of enough.</p>
<p>Initially, this was inspired by tiding and decluttering. We were sorting through our books when I kept coming across books I had never read, over 50 in total. I thought I would try not to buy any more this year. I have enough. The same goes for games. I recently got a PS5 and the temptation is to buy loads of games for it, but it came with ten or so - more than enough to keep me busy. Plus games are so long these days, I'm still playing <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p>
<p>This got me thinking about what enough looks like. We are asked to always find more, to consume more, to buy more. But maybe we have all we need already. I'd like to continue decluttering my physical and digital surroundings, to find what is necessary.</p>
<p>I also have a tendency to try new systems and apps whenever they come round, jumping from different workflows to shiny new ways of working. I'd like to dig into my existing systems more, such as Obsidian and Eleventy, and really make them work to the best of my abilities. I'd also like to go to the river more (as defined in <a href="https://dophs.substack.com/p/how-its-made">this excellent article</a>), using the many random notes I've made to myself over this year.</p>
<p>Enough can also be building up what you have, not just cutting down. I see enough as investing in my own self esteem and confidence. I'd like to build them back after a rough year.</p>
<p>So for the next year I'm hoping to define these boundaries for myself. Dig into what I already have and find a good balance between too much and too little. I don't know if it will shake out like that, but the advantage of setting a theme is you can use it as a north star, set your intention towards it and use it to guide you.</p>

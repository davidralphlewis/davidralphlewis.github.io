<p>Come sip the festive juice.<br>
It tastes of cinnamon, cloves,<br>
something strange you can't discern.<br>
Join us in the circle as we chant,<br>
<em>Tis the Season, Tis the Season</em></p>
<p>Feel your head expand and contract,<br>
like a blinking light on a tree.<br>
Watch as the world is delayed<br>
by half a second, maybe more.<br>
<em>Tis the Season, Tis the Season</em></p>
<p>Hear the chant continue like<br>
a runaway train, your mouth moving<br>
without thought, unstoppable now.<br>
Try to clench your jaw shut. Fail.<br>
<em>Tis the Season, Tis the Season</em></p>
<p>Understand, like falling from a cliff,<br>
this ritual is older than the holiday.<br>
older than the first human societies.<br>
Around fires, they called to the darkness<br>
<em>Tis the Season, Tis the Season</em></p>
<p>Leave your body far behind.<br>
Become one with us in the circle,<br>
unsure of where you end and begin,<br>
as we call to the cruel ancient god<br>
<em>Tis the Season, Tis the Season</em></p>

<p>Thanks to The Bristol Magazine for the <a href="https://thebristolmag.co.uk/sip-the-festive-juice-with-bristol-syrup-co/">incredibly creepy headline</a> about cocktails, that was phrased in such an odd way I had to write this.</p>

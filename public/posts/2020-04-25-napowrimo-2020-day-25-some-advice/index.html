<p>I wouldn't open that door if I were you.<br>
Last year I stored the Atlantic ocean<br>
behind it, stuffed it into every corner.<br>
I only just managed to close the latch.<br>
If opened, the room will fill with brine,<br>
the house as well, the streets of this<br>
sea-level town all submerged and we will<br>
sink down to rest on the carpet below.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn't open that door either.<br>
for you will see a short corridor, leading<br>
to another door, which leads to a short<br>
corridor, leading to yet another door-<br>
you get my point. After weeks you may<br>
turn back, to be faced with the same<br>
endless recursion of impossible doors.</p>
<p>That's where I store my collection of<br>
nebulae and black holes, that one there<br>
leads straight to the hurricane hangar.</p>
<p>Only the last one is out of bounds,<br>
the wooden door a foot high, there<br>
above the skirting board in the corner.<br>
I keep the key around my neck on a chain.<br>
It's alarmed, but you wouldn't know it.<br>
That's where I keep my worries. Inside,<br>
a cupboard of ink-stained shadows,<br>
paper torn into confetti, a whistling,<br>
quiet and high, with no visible origin.</p>
<hr>
<p>Prompt became the opening line- &quot;I wouldn't open that door if I were you&quot; from Apples and Snakes</p>

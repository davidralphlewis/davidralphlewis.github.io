<p>They sometimes shine torches over the strata<br>
of compressed time, with sweeping, shaking<br>
hands. Eternity is present in their half smiles.</p>
<p>He carries a sadness for a long dead myth<br>
that he longs to bury in the river far below.</p>
<p>She longs for a bridge in the same way you<br>
want to win the lottery but never buy a ticket.</p>
<p>They talk in clouds that never quite merge.<br>
Unnoticed by them both, in the shadows,</p>
<p>a man sits at a piano and plays Debussy,<br>
the notes falling and fading into red dust.</p>
<p>This isn't a climax to a Nora Ephron film.<br>
They avoid eye contact. Later, she will text him<br>
'I searched for your flashlight but got lost.'</p>
<p>Night falls across the mesa like a stone<br>
bouncing off a cliff into the welcoming earth.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sorry to the people I saw who inspired this poem. I'm sure you were having a perfectly nice time in reality.</p>
<p>I was experimenting with consistency of images here. Not sure it fully works, but I liked some of the lines.</p>

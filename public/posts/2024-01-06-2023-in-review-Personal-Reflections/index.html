<p>Once again I closed off last year and started the new one by filling out a <a href="https://yearcompass.com/">year compass</a> booklet. Although the years are arbitrary, I find this time to reflect and reset immensely valuable.</p>
<p>As I did <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/">last year</a>, I've decided to also summarise the year in a personal way, as opposed to my <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk//2023-in-review">rants</a> about politics. It's reasonably long, so strap in.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>I wrote late last year about my desire to <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/slowing-down/">slow down</a> a bit, reflecting it in my review of <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/2022-in-review-personal-reflections/">2022</a>. I wanted a fallow year, to regroup and reflect more. For the first half of the year, I was reasonably successful. I had surgery to remove my gallbladder[^1] and as a result I needed to not do anything for a little bit. I was lucky to make a full recovery quickly, but the time off forced me to do less. Life moved on of course, and I ended up filling my time with more distractions.</p>
<p>I also moved to the countryside this year, which was a welcome change of pace. I'm forty five minutes outside of Bristol now, which is close enough to go into work but far enough that I feel a little removed from the city.</p>
<p>The latter half of the year has been tough in a few ways I'm not going into here, but it was healing to be surrounded by nature and to watch the seasons change.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to go to lots of interesting places this year. Bilbao and San Sebastian were culinary delights, with incredible food and amazing culture. Bluedot festival was a lot of fun [^2], with science talks, comedy and excellent live music. I also spent a week in Cornwall for my wedding anniversary, watching the sea and reading.</p>
<p>Although some things have been a struggle, I am lucky in so many ways. I am reminded of this daily.</p>
<h2>Writing</h2>
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://www.davidralphlewis.co.uk/on-submissions/">here</a>, I deliberately wanted to avoid submitting to journals this year. I took the pressure off myself and instead focused on writing poems. I aimed for one a week, which I didn't always hit. But that's ok, because I think I've successfully reset my writing process, slowing down making poems and taking more time for editing. I've also found a lot more joy and fun in the process itself. I'd like to keep the attention more on the process of writing, not the end result.</p>
<h2>Books</h2>
<p>I read <a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/books23">38 books</a> last year, a little less than my usual.</p>
<p><em>The Broken Earth</em> trilogy by N.K. Jemisen was my clear favourite speculative series I read last year, with a wildly inventive setting and unique, well realised characters. Somehow, Jemisen manages to keep the balance between tiny moments of character and huge moments of world building.</p>
<p>Close behind was <em>Black Sun</em> by Rebecca Roanhorse, which is a fantasy novel based on pre-Columbus American legends. It also has excellent world building and a jaw dropping ending.</p>
<p>Other novels I enjoyed were <em>Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow</em> by Gabrielle Zevin, which is about games and the joy of collaborating with others. It avoids cliché and goes in some really interesting directions. <em>Our Wives Under the Sea</em> by Julia Armfield also avoids cliché, lying somewhere between social realism and horror to create a compelling tale about grieving someone while they are still alive. <em>To The Lighthouse</em> by Virginia Woolf was a reread, but I lost myself to the beautiful music of her sentences.</p>
<p><em>Wintering</em> by Katherine May was my favourite non-fiction book I read, dealing with the necessity of rest and recovering from unexpected sad times, and acknowledging and accepting them.</p>
<p>Poetry wise, I loved <em>Deep Wheel Orcadia</em>, a sci-fi novel written in verse and in Orkney dialect. It was beautiful and profound, and completely unique. I read a lot of books by Bristol poets as well, with <em>The Nation's Saddest Love Poems</em> by Sam J. Grudgings being sad, tender and only slightly horrific. <em>Faulty Manufacturing</em> by Josie Alford is a brutally honest exploration of her complicated feelings after the death of her father, with end lines that absolutely cut you deep. Finally, <em>Health Hireth</em> by Taran Spalding Jenkins is a pamphlet of lyrical beauty that explores myth, illness and language, with poems written in Kernewek and translated back into English.</p>
<p>I think with all my reading this year the things I've enjoyed the most have been doing something new or different, expanding the possibilities of language and story.</p>
<h2>Music</h2>
<p>An unintentional side effect of moving to the country was I listened to a lot more new music, as my commute into the office twice a week is the perfect time to stick on an album.</p>
<p>My favourite album of the year was <em>Heavy Heavy</em> by Young Fathers. It's an incredible genre hopping album full of surprises and twists and turns, sometimes rap, sometimes soul, sometimes choral unity. I was lucky enough to see them at Bluedot and it elevated the album for me, as live they are powerful and full of intense amounts of energy.</p>
<p>I also listened a lot to <em>After the Magic</em>, by Paranoul, which is intense in a different way, mixing elements of shoegaze and indie rock together to create a heady sonic mix. The production makes everything clear though and it never gets lost in the muddy sound the way some post rock stuff does. Jeff Rosenstock's album <em>HELLMODE</em> was also a highlight, being pop punk songs about healing and improving.</p>
<p>In quieter moments, I looked to <em>Does Spring Hide It's Joy</em>,  a two hour cello drone album by Kali Malone. I found the extended cello notes to be hypnotic and mesmerising. A late entry was King Creosote's <em>I DES</em>, a beautiful folk album about death and grief, with some dancier tracks. It's lush and beautiful.</p>
<p>Other music I enjoyed includes <em>Radical Romantics</em> by Fever Ray, <em>Integrated Tech Solutions</em> by Aesop Rock, <em>Live at Bush Hall</em> by Black Country, New Road[^3] and <em>The Record</em> by boygenuis. It was a really good year for music and I hope to carry on listening with the same intensity. The more I explore new music, the more I find.</p>
<h2>Games</h2>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>  &amp; <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>-  I spent a lot of this year exploring Hyrule. <em>Breath of the Wild</em> is slower and more contemplative, whereas <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> is more frantic. Both games offer a rich open world to get lost in, full of detail and unique moments. Exploration is rewarded and you always feel like you are forging your own path. I explored almost every nook of Hyrule and enjoyed every moment of it. Truly, both games are stunning works of art.</p>
<p>I also played a fair bit of <em>Fortnite</em>. I'm terrible at it but it's a good social experience.</p>
<p>I also spent quite a lot of time this year planning and running a new <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> campaign, having wrapped up a heavily modified version of <em>Lost Mines of Phandelver</em>. I'm the DM and its a lot of fun seeing the unexpected ways sessions turn out.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVGuFdX5guE">C G P Grey</a>, I like setting themes for the year instead of resolution. Last year my theme was &quot;A fallow year&quot;, which spoke to what I wanted to do- slow down, reassess and find joy in things. I think I was mostly sucesssful.</p>
<p>This year, I'd like to build on that but not hermit myself away so much. I have a tendency to avoid the rest of the world, having mostly solitary hobbies like writing poems and swimming. I'd like to strike a balance between resting, working on projects by myself and meeting and engaging with cool people. My theme for this year is therefore simply &quot;connection&quot;- with the moment, with my work, but most of all with others. If you're reading this far and you're a cool artist looking for a collaboration, drop me an email. If you're a friend, lets catch up.</p>
<p>I hope the next year is good for everyone reading this.</p>
<p>[^1]: All praise must go to the team at the BRI, for their care and attention. The NHS is such a precious resource, we must fight to keep it.
[^2]: It was also very wet and muddy, but that didn't matter.
[^3]: I also saw them at Bluedot, they were also excellent. I love how they have pulled themselves out of the ashes and formed a whole new experience after their lead singer left. <em>Turbine/ Pigs</em> is maybe my favourite song of the year.</p>

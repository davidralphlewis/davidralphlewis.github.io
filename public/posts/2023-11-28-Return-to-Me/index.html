<p>Once again, you find yourself barefoot,<br>
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps<br>
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge<br>
of your island, listening to my breathing,<br>
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle<br>
sigh, the dance of a million small particles<br>
rearranging themselves in new patterns.<br>
The sun is already setting, elongating<br>
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and<br>
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air.</p>
<p>Once again. you have found your feet uncertain,<br>
untethered to the land you live in. You have<br>
been drifting like morning mist, over footpaths<br>
and stiles, your destination unclear. You have<br>
been translucent, with ill defined borders.<br>
So you find yourself in front of me,<br>
walking forwards as wind ripples your chest.<br>
I am cold but you stay anyway. I can feel<br>
each small leg hair standing surprised.</p>
<p>Let me take your burdens, the ones you have carried<br>
for so long now without realising. As you<br>
wade further in, let me hold your intrusive<br>
thoughts, your vague worries. Let me wash<br>
the soil and land from your skin. Float now.<br>
Lie on your back, starfished. Float.<br>
Forget all the regular thoughts and patterns<br>
you loosely define as a self. Let them drift,<br>
become diffuse and bob towards the horizon.<br>
Float now, forgetting who or where you are.</p>
<p>Once again the sun sits and light fades.<br>
Once again you have to pull your limbs<br>
together, become something like a person,<br>
define the boundaries of your being.<br>
Of course, you can't stay here forever.<br>
Once again, you pull on wrinkled cotton,<br>
shock of small scratches over skin.<br>
With a sigh, I regift your problems to you,<br>
not solved, but buffed clean and polished,<br>
shining smooth glass. Return to me<br>
with anything you wish to bring<br>
more into light, anything you wish to define.<br>
I will be waiting here, lapping the land,<br>
speaking in susurrations to the sandstone and the shore.</p>

<p>I was delighted to be asked onto the Full House Literary Podcast talking about poetry and mental health. It was a thought provoking, interesting discussion that was quite wide ranging. Thanks so much to them for having me on, listen <a href="https://www.fullhouseliterary.com/podcast-epsisodes/mental-health-and-writing-roundtable">here.</a></p>

<p>Speaking of poetry, I'm volunteering at <a href="https://www.lyrafest.com/">Lyra Festival</a> in Bristol over the next couple of weeks. It looks to be a really fascinating series of events, I'm also competing in the slam. If you'd like to come along to the qualifying rounds you can sign up on zoom <a href="https://www.lyrafest.com/#events/e72148">here.</a></p>

<p>After swearing never to do it again, I've given this site another spruce up. I replaced my creaking, stapled together code with theme called <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a> and I'm a lot happier with it. I've also spruced up my <a href="https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/">notes pages</a> to make them more legible and removed all analytics. I don't have any comments on the pages either so now the only way to contact me is by email. A bit of a spring clean of my digital footprint. I'm pleased with this latest evolution of the site, it's much more how I wanted it to be.</p>

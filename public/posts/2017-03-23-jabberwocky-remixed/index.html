<p>Inspired by <a href="http://poetryasf-ck.tumblr.com/">Poetry as Fuck</a> and <a href="http://imaginaryadvice.tumblr.com/">Imaginary Advice</a>, I spent a morning remixing* Jabberwocky* by Lewis Carrol. Because...? I'm not really sure why. Anyway, here are the results. In this first one, I replacedÂ words with common names. Weirdly, it still makes a sort of sense:</p>
<h2>Jerry-Walt</h2>
<p>`Twas Bradley, and the Susan Todd's<br>
Did Gary and Genevieve in the Wade:<br>
All Maureen were the Bernie-Gregs,<br>
And the Mae Rolfs out-Gabe.</p>
<p>&quot;Beware the Jerry-Walt, my son!<br>
The Jakes that bite, the Calum that catch!<br>
Beware the John-John bird, and shun<br>
The Francesca Barnaby-Sam!&quot;</p>
<p>He took his Vinny sword in hand:<br>
Long time the Mackenzie foe he sought --<br>
So rested he by the TomTom tree,<br>
And stood awhile in thought.</p>
<p>And, as in Ulrich thought he stood,<br>
The Jerry-Walt, with eyes of Fay,<br>
Came Whitney through the Tammy wood,<br>
And Barry-ed as it came!</p>
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through<br>
The Vinny blade went Simon-Sid!<br>
He left it dead, and with its Hugh<br>
He went Gareth-ing back.</p>
<p>&quot;And, has thou slain the Jerry-Walt?<br>
Come to my arms, my Bethany boy!<br>
O Frederica day! Carlos! Casey!'<br>
He Charlotte-d in his joy.</p>
<p>`Twas Bradley, and the Susan Todd's<br>
Did Gary and Genevieve in the Wade:<br>
All Maureen were the Bernie-Gregs,<br>
And the Mae Rolfs out-Gabe.</p>
<p>In the second, I translated the poem into Arabic and then back into English:</p>
<h2>Jabrok</h2>
<p>`Tuas Preleg, and Tuthili Slythi<br>
Are Gir and Gamble in Webby:<br>
All Mimsey Boroughves,<br>
And Momi Rathas Uttragabi.</p>
<p>&quot;Beware of Jabrok, my son!<br>
Jaws that bite, claws that catch!<br>
Beware the birds of Gobjub, and Shawn<br>
And Banderzenach is reckless!&quot;</p>
<p>His sword of Forbal was at hand:<br>
Manxum's long-sought enemy -<br>
So rested is by Tomtom tree,<br>
I stood a moment in thought.</p>
<p>As in Ovech I think he stood up,<br>
And Jabrok, with the eyes of the flame,<br>
Nfling came through the Tulji wood,<br>
And Bourbard also came!</p>
<p>One, two! One, two! It is through and through<br>
I went for the Sniper-Forbal blade - a snack!<br>
Leave him dead, and with his head<br>
He went back.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you kill Jabrok?<br>
Come to my arm, boy boy!<br>
O Frabgos today! Calo! Calai!&quot;<br>
So he rose in joy.</p>
<p>`Tuas Preleg, and Tuthili Slythi<br>
Gir and Gimpel in Webby.<br>
All Mimsey Boroughves,<br>
And Momi Rathas Uttragabi.</p>
<p>Finally, like I have done previously <a href="/feeding-my-writing-through-a-digital-shredder/">with my own poems</a>, I used a <a href="http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Gibber/GibGen.htm">Markov chain generator</a> to break the poem and re-edited it into a new, grimmer version:</p>
<h2>Borogove</h2>
<p>Borogove, (from the slithy manxome)<br>
Came to frumious Jubjub,<br>
took a looking-glass to his eyes<br>
and saw all were in thought.</p>
<p>&quot;The catch! Catch! Outgrabe&quot;<br>
burbled Borogove in flame.<br>
&quot;Beware! The toves do gyre!<br>
Raths are the mimsy! Beware!&quot;</p>
<p>The vorpal brillig came whiffling<br>
through the back blade, with eyes<br>
in hand. Borogove was left dead,<br>
resting by the tulgey wood.</p>
<p>Alice found him there,<br>
jaws slithy and his gimble slain.<br>
&quot;Callooh! Callooh! Callooh! Callooh!<br>
My mome boy! My bandersnatch bird!</p>
<p>Long time she uffish stood<br>
in burbled thought. Snicker-snack<br>
went the callay claws.<br>
Snicker-snack.</p>

<p>That's it for now. I might do more in the future. I hope you enjoyed them.</p>

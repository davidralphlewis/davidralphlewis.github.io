<p>I have been unable to describe the shape<br>
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning<br>
for our forgotten winter in a language<br>
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky<br>
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,<br>
orange markers bleeding through the page.<br>
My garden whispers like a fading dream<br>
as thoughts transmute to smoke,<br>
wisp and separate and float. Recently</p>
<p>too many people have died. This fog cloud<br>
of breath, this speaking in mist feels<br>
like a betrayal. Against whom I am not sure.</p>
<p>I watch beech leaves sway like incense,<br>
invent new scripts in goose pimples,<br>
inhale the sharp scent of lemon balm,<br>
that has started to grow through patio cracks.<br>
Here is my hand, the pale and blotchy skin,<br>
the small scars from cooking mishaps<br>
the squat thumb. Here, it is reaching<br>
to hold the still warm coffee cup,<br>
vapours of steam like prayers.</p>
<p>Listen. The robin and the chiff chaff<br>
are starting to form full sentences.</p>

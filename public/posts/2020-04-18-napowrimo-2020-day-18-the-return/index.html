<p>When I landed I felt the weight<br>
of myself rush back into my body<br>
like water through an open dam.<br>
I was thankful for no longer<br>
being a raindrop. I saw the sky<br>
as an ocean we swim through daily.</p>
<p>When I landed I felt the spinning<br>
of the planet under my shaking feet,<br>
a constant treadmill, a dizziness.<br>
I understood it was always this way.</p>
<p>When I landed I felt the breeze<br>
stroke my skin and breathed in<br>
all the blooms of the world.<br>
For a second I heard the voices<br>
of the stratosphere and spoke<br>
in reply with quick exhales.</p>
<p>When I landed those dreams ended.</p>
<p>When I landed I left a part of myself<br>
floating but never falling. I longed<br>
to release myself from gravity again,<br>
to leap and sublimate this limited body,<br>
join the air currents and become diffuse.</p>

<p>Prompt was to &quot;use anaphora&quot; from AmyKayPoetry. I didn't quite use it correctly as it's meant to be successive phrases but I liked the end result.</p>

<p>I came into office<br>
<em>because in my possession was an ancient grimoire,</em><br>
at a time of great economic and international instability<br>
<em>from which a few will profit, the system working as it should.</em><br>
Families and businesses were worried about<br>
<em>being suspended over a bottomless chasm with sharp teeth;</em><br>
about how to pay their bills;<br>
<em>about flesh chewed down by ice, no help forthcoming.</em></p>
<p>Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security<br>
<em>of our supply lines and our profit margins</em><br>
of our whole continent.<br>
<em>We do not think about those huddled in shelled buildings.</em><br>
And our country has been<br>
<em>a playground for rich fools dabbling in the occult</em><br>
held back for too long by low economic growth.<br>
<em>All hail eternal expansion, the flame that never flickers.</em></p>
<p>I was elected by the Conservative Party with<br>
<em>an ancient Sumerian chant, goat's blood and hemgrove, told to recite</em><br>
a mandate to change<br>
<em>reality itself, if read in the right order, just like</em><br>
this. We delivered on energy bills,<br>
<em>ensuring we had bodies for the pyres</em><br>
and on cutting National Insurance.<br>
<em>The abyss gurgled with joy. We praised the great devourer.</em><br>
And we set out a vision for a<br>
<em>time when the ancient ones would roam freely, summoning a</em><br>
low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of<br>
<em>our weary and beaten population. How many will we sacrifice to gain</em><br>
the freedoms of Brexit.</p>
<p>I recognise, though, given the situation,<br>
<em>our rituals were ineffective. We were so certain.</em><br>
I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected<br>
<em>because the stars have grown cold, destroyed</em><br>
by the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>I have therefore spoken to His Majesty<br>
<em>Mammon, the destroyer, the hungry void and</em><br>
the King<br>
<em>of all that lies below</em>,<br>
to notify him that I am<br>
<em>merely a sack of skin hollowed by atrocities, so I am</em><br>
resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.<br>
<em>I preached consumption and was surprised when I was consumed.</em></p>
<p>This morning, I met the chairman of the<br>
<em>order, the high priest of the fearful</em><br>
1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.<br>
<em>I offered my neck in penance but was denied release.</em><br>
We've agreed<br>
<em>to sleep in shadows, waiting the perfect time. We decided</em><br>
that there will be a leadership election, to be completed<br>
<em>in the secret places where light refuses to tread</em><br>
within the next week.</p>
<p>This will ensure that we remain on a path to<br>
<em>feed on the rubble of a dying world, start the magicks to</em><br>
deliver our fiscal plans and maintain<br>
<em>our connection to the great mouth hidden in rock, to sacrifice</em><br>
our country's economic stability and national<br>
<em>stock of limbs and sinew, necessary fuel for our</em><br>
security. I will remain<br>
<em>a squelching thing, a writhing mass of tentacles acting</em><br>
as Prime Minister until a successor has been<br>
<em>pulled from the sucking mud, annoited with methane to become the</em><br>
chosen<br>
<em>one to lead us into the eternal night.</em><br>
Thank you.</p>

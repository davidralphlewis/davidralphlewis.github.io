<p>because there was no danger or threat,<br>
no unwanted developments. There were no murders<br>
because we melted down our knives and guns<br>
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.<br>
War is now an archaic word, like famine<br>
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago<br>
and every person has enough to eat and drink,<br>
has all the resources and support they need<br>
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone<br>
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,<br>
but it is never unexpected and always<br>
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion<br>
or anything other difference, is a bright candle<br>
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone<br>
combined together to light up the dark.</p>
<p>So the news anchors stood up from their desks,<br>
wiped off their makeup<br>
disconnected their ear pieces<br>
and wandered out of the studio<br>
into the peace of the forest.<br>
Under an emerald canopy<br>
they kicked off<br>
their sensible shoes<br>
and felt soil and soft moss<br>
between their toes<br>
as dappled light danced<br>
for joy over their skin.</p>

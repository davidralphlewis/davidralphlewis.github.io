<h2>Emergency Protocol</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  
<p>If you are hearing these words<br />  
then our efforts were futile. <br />  
We were an ant trying to halt<br />  
an avalanche, a single voice<br />  
trying to cross the endless void. </p>  
<p>I was no-one important, a bureaucrat<br /> following the train tracks left <br /> by countless generations. Not many<br /> of us can switch tracks or derail without<br /> wrenching metal and screaming sparks.</p>  
<p>I record this message as an emissary<br /> from the past, from your former government,<br /> but it will be clear to all of you listening<br /> that all our institutions and borders <br /> were always illusory, tricks of the light.</p>  
<p>We congregated as one and decided<br /> to create numerous systems together,<br /> will them into being, change the outcome<br /> by observation and belief. We forgot<br /> our complex creations were just fictions.</p>  
<p>It pains me to think of you listening to this.<br />  
We are sorry. We were blind in so many ways. </p>  
<p>There is little to be done now<br /> but to listen to seeds split open and grow,<br /> feel your heart thump, reminder of life,<br /> and to spend time with those you love.<br /> That's all there ever was.  </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

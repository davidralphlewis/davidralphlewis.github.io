<p><em>This a series where I interview poets about their process and writing in reference to a single poem. Today we have Pascal Vine, an excellent poet, a captivating performer and part of the team over at Bristol Tonic. He is discussing a poem he has performed for years.</em></p>
<hr>
<h2>Pride flags at dawn</h2>
<p>You don’t want their god;<br>
A god for the gently used,<br>
The Pre-loved, still in packaging,<br>
one channel, tv static god,<br>
cosmic interference<br>
but won’t put a good word in god.</p>
<p>A god who won’t hold your hand in public,<br>
A god who “doesn’t do gifts”,<br>
A god who’s not open at weekends,<br>
A god that doesn’t come in your size,<br>
A god who can afford to lose some flock.</p>
<p>None of us are pure.<br>
The paint in his self portrait was tainted<br>
with the birth of colour,<br>
we have a rainbow ass god,<br>
with children on the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>A duct tape,<br>
frayed patch jacket,<br>
chapped lip smiling god;<br>
cut her own bangs,<br>
stuffed her own bra,<br>
band camp having god.</p>
<p>A god who makes those who make themselves;<br>
has a hundred names and as many phases,<br>
and as many faces and it never phased her.<br>
Who watches over surgeries and skipped breakfast.<br>
Who doesn’t need prayer when you’re crying in the bathroom or fucking in there.<br>
Because god makes those who don’t make things easy;<br>
burning seraph wings unfurling from a newborn chest,<br>
muttering cherubs orbiting your head,<br>
Jesus with his arm around your ex,<br>
A holy book you had to write yourself.<br>
God’s read it.</p>
<p>On the first day they made day and night,<br>
but it only gets dark as a pretense;<br>
he hasn’t rested if you haven’t,<br>
she hasn’t known love<br>
if you haven’t named it<br>
like the first animals in Eden,<br>
it better be on all fours for you before it is worthy.</p>
<p>But there are pride flags at sunrise in the heavens<br>
before anyone can raise hell,<br>
ones that haven’t even been invented.</p>
<p>promises unbroken;<br>
everything on earth is yours.</p>

<p><em>D: Can you remember your initial starting point for this poem?</em></p>
<p>P: My starting point was that I wanted to write about how I perceived god. I wanted to let people know how I saw divinity, and how it could be so much more than how we usually interpret the divine. I think it was inspired by the scruffy bathrooms in Crofters Rights in Bristol, I seem to remember someone writing something like 'god was here' on the bathroom cubicle and it got me thinking.</p>
<p><em>D: I love the idea of finding inspiration in the strangest places. So did you have to revise this poem a lot or did you have a clear idea of how you perceived god?</em></p>
<p>P: My writing process usually happens in one big sneeze where I bash out the poem in ten minutes and then I edit it for months and months after, sometimes years. I believe I first wrote this in a pub in Bristol on a solo day trip, and I remember it being very clunky in the first draft.</p>
<p>I had the ideas but there was a lot of explanation, description of the God 'Character' in the poem. I also remember writing a lot more theological references, but I realised I didn't need them and people might feel turned off by the poem if I included a lot of complicated theological terminology for no reason. (I think I unconsciously put it in there to show off.)</p>
<p><em>D: Did you ever perform the first draft or did you edit before?</em></p>
<p>P: Yes, I think there's a video of that. This is possibly the older version</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Na3qbpCTyLU</p>
<p>Regardless, I know I performed the older version beforehand, possibly at Bath Spa's RAR. I think its the best way of getting to know a poem.</p>
<p><em>D: Ah that's really cool to see how it's changed.</em></p>
<p><em>Tell me a bit more about getting to know a poem,  how do you use performance to edit a poem?</em></p>
<p>P: Firstly I take note of how I find saying the poem aloud. It’s important to constantly check how it sounds aloud as you write, especially if you’re angling for a performance poem, and performing for an audience provides extra insight into mistakes you may have glossed over when speaking it to yourself.</p>
<p>I have a stutter, and my lips aren’t great at tongue twisters so I had to change and rearrange some words so that I didn’t stumble on them so much. You can hear in the video I didn’t warm up my voice before I got on stage, so I hitched on a few words.</p>
<p>The second thing I take note of is how the audience reacts; did they laugh at a joke? Did they sigh? Did they click? Are there hums of approval or nods? I like performing poetry because the audience tends to be very expressive. I always find in my poems someone will laugh at something I did intend, and it also allows me to think about my delivery and how best to tell the audience the poem.</p>
<p>So looking back on the poem, I found the best parts were the ones that flowed and added to the rhythm. Anything that took away from the structure, or needless repeated, I took out.</p>
<p><em>D: Awesome. So with the constant editing of the poem, is there ever a point where you consider it finished? Or are they always evolving?</em></p>
<p>P: I don’t think there’s a hard line, as experience with what you’re writing about and how you feel about it changes so I can always find something to edit if I want to. It’s whether I find the need to which I think defines it for me.</p>
<p>My ethos with poetry is to convey a specific message as clearly and efficiently as possible within the art of the poem. Once I find a poem gets across exactly what I need it to say, I retire from editing it.</p>
<p><em>D: Does your process vary if you aren't writing for performance, for Instagram or magazines for example?</em></p>
<p>P: Absolutely — if I write for Instagram I write all in one chunk and I only correct for grammar. Which, yes, is sloppy. But it’s also relaxing and fun. I think it’s important to let yourself write without too much pressure at times without hoarding every piece of poetry you write to submit to journals.</p>
<p>For journals, or personal work, I work from a kernel of an idea and develop it over and over. It involves a lot of rearranging and rewriting. I often go through 5 to 10 drafts before I’m happy to publish something.</p>
<p><em>D: Final question, in all your years of rewriting and performing this poem has your interpretation of it changed?</em></p>
<p>P: I think at first this poem was a rebellion against what I perceived as Christianity attacking queerness, and now, 2 or 3 years on, I feel like it was my first step back into accepting some Christianity back into my spirituality.</p>
<p>Its not somewhat of a welcome home for me; I have had an audience member or two confirm that it was a new way of seeing God or spirituality for them, and that was really nice to hear that I could give people a different perspective, rather than out right attacking something I didn't agree with entirely.</p>
<p>D: Thank you so much.</p>

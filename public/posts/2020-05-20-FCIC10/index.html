<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> We are here at the tenth Future of Computational Intelligence conference (#FCIC10). We sponsor a number of PhD students, excited to see their findings!</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> Key note in ten minutes. Still get nervous even now. Wish me luck! #FCIC10</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @ProfSam You’ll be great</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @ElaineEvans Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @ProfSam I hope u get lost in the desert and die u moran.</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> #FCIC10 is another sham by @PhatheonOfficial. What are they hiding with this fake academic conference?</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @fr0gk!ller! That’s it, you’re grounded.</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @ProfSam Hahahahahah lol w/e, hope u get canser and die. 1 of the bad onns</p>
<p><strong>DeptofCS:</strong> Inspiring to watch @ProfSam give the keynote at #FCIC10 today. Brilliant stuff.</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> Kicking off #FCIC10 with an interesting speech by @ProfSam. His research helps power a number of our advanced medical tracking programs involving nanobots- keeping you healthy, safe and secure.</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> Congratulations @ProfSam! Great talk, a lot to think about there!</p>
<p><strong>MattPhd:</strong> I’m at #FCIC10. I’m so lucky! Really good day to be here!</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @ElaineEvans Thanks, thought it went down well.</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> Gutted I can’t be at #FCIC10 but am bed-bound. Flu is the worst.</p>
<p><strong>Barb45621:</strong> @ProfSam why didn’t you take questions after your talk i have some questions about your research thanks where are you ..</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @DrKradow Oh no, sorry to hear that. Flu is horrible! You can still watch on the live stream: www.tinyurl.co/467p0</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @Barb45621 Just having a break, to be honest. Need a rest after the excitement. We ran out of time for questions.</p>
<p><strong>Barb45621:</strong> @ProfSam I want to talk to you where are you I’m in the lobby thanks</p>
<p><strong>Barb45621:</strong> @ProfSam I have some follow up questions about your research and I wanted to speak to you about them and the future and where its going to go and some suggestions you might find interesting</p>
<p>... : <em>&gt; run_protocol-46y8m</em></p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> @ElaineEvans That link doesn’t work, is it on the faculty main page?</p>
<p><strong>Barb45621:</strong> #FCIC10 Lights have gone????</p>
<p><strong>DeptofCS:</strong> Apologies for the powercut at #FCIC10. Both backup generators failed at the same time: what are the odds? We are working to get it up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> Small delay at #FCIC10 as we work hard to restore power. Dependable renewable energy and increased battery capacity are some of the areas we are working on. @Bryonytheblue is presenting later on using AI to solve the energy crisis. One of the many areas Phaethon is working in.</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> Very convenient of @PhaethonOfficial to have a power cut in the middle of their #FCIC10 conference. Could they be any more suspicious? Look at my channel for more details.</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> @ProfSam Still not appeared i need to speak to you thank you.</p>
<p><strong>MattPhd:</strong> Power may be out at #FCIC10 but lots of insightful and fascinating conversations to be had! #blessed.</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> LOl youre conference is lame and you are lame tooo @ProfSam @PhaethonOffical why are you even breathing still lollll</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @ProfKradow Ooops sorry, yes, it’s on the main page.</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> And we’re back! Up and running again at #FCIC10. Only a small delay, it shouldn’t affect the timings too much. On with the research!</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> Oops wrong account! Sorry, everyone! Now you know who is behind the curtain ;)</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> @<strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> Watching now, thank you! Wonders of technology eh?</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @fr0gk!ller Why did you copy in my employer to this? I’m furious.</p>
<p><strong>DeptofCS:</strong> And we’re back! Up and running again at #FCIC10. Only a small delay, it shouldn’t affect the timings too much. On with the research!</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @ProfSam @PhaethonOfficial You mad brooooo?</p>
<p><strong>BryonytheBlue:</strong> I’m at #FCIC10 and presenting in an hour. Wish me luck. #gulp</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @fr0gk!ller Yes of course I’m annoyed. It may be funny to you but this is my reputation. I know who you are, you can’t hide behind the stupid username.</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> @ProfSam @fr0gk!ller We do not appreciate direct threats of violence. We strongly condone them and have a official policy to follow.</p>
<p><strong>Eoin_88:</strong> @BryonytheBlue Good luck Brie! Don't screw it all up.</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> @ProfSam Why wont you answer questions i have a number of points regarding your research.</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> #FCIC10 shows @PhaethonOfficial to be dangerous liars. I’m going to expose the truth, go to my channel.</p>
<p><strong>...:</strong> <em>&gt; protocol 46y8m-- status: failed.</em></p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @PhaethonOfficial Choke on my fat dik, world killerz</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @PhaethonOfficial It’s my son. He’s just doing it to lash out. I’m so so sorry: I’ll take the blame.</p>
<p><strong>BryonytheBlue:</strong> @Eoin_88 Not sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @Barb46521 Sorry I’ve had some other things to deal with. I will probably be around at lunch if you would like to speak to me then?</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> @fr0gk!ller We are investigating your IP and there will be consequences.</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> @DeptofCS @ElaineEvans What’s wrong with the live stream?</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @PhaethonOfficial Oh no the big mega corporatation is coming after the little guy wah wah wha im so scared.</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @BryonytheBlue Good luck</p>
<p><strong>MattPhd:</strong> Just had a really insightful chat with @ElaineEvans at #FCIC10. Great!</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> Typical bullying from @PhaethonOfficial, silencing @fr0gk!ller for speaking out against them.</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> @ProfSam coward we can’t all be on television</p>
<p><strong>...:</strong> <em>&gt;reroute_resave_protocol-46y8n</em></p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @DrKradow just paused for the break.</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> Looking forward to our sponsored PhD student @BryonytheBlue presenting her research in predictive energy generation using computer learning.</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @RobinHood to right, they don’t want to hear it looool. Them and @ProfSam want to shut me up.</p>
<p><strong>BryonytheBlue:</strong> I can’t do i. I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> Too much waiting around at #FCIC10 and @ProfSam wont even speak to the lesser people disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> Typical academic @ProfSam is silencing @fr0gk!ller. Knowledge for those in the ivory tower, not for the masses. I’m here and I’m going to expose #FCIC10 and @PhaethonOfficial for what they really are.</p>
<p><strong>ElaineEvans:</strong> @BryonytheBlue Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>BryonytheBlue:</strong> @ElaineEvans Sorry, I thought that was private.</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> @RobinHood He’s my son. Please don’t jump to conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> @ProfSam So rude.</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> @ElaineEvans Thanks, it’s back up</p>
<p><strong>DeptofCS:</strong> Now at #FCIC10, @BryonytheBlue on stage to present her research on using computer learning for energy modelling.</p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> Unveiling a banner now. Expose the lies! @PhaethonOfficial are evil! Watch my Channel.</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> How did a protestor get in?</p>
<p><strong>Barb46521:</strong> This is a shambles #FCIC10</p>
<p><strong>ProfSam:</strong> What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>DeptofCS:</strong> Sorry about the disruption. The protestor has now been removed. On with @Bryonytheblue’s paper</p>
<p><strong>...:</strong> <em>&gt;run_protocol-46y8n</em></p>
<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> Forcibly removed from #FCIC10 for telling the truth! So much for freedom of speech! Expose the lies @PhaethonOfficial</p>
<p><strong>fr0gk!ller:</strong> @RobinHood That suuuuuks</p>
<p><strong>...:</strong> <em>&gt; Initialising...</em></p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> @RobinHood @fr0gk!ller We will be pushing for charges for both of you.</p>

<p><strong>RobinHood:</strong> ...</p>
<p><strong>PhaethonOfficial:</strong> ...</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> Is anyone else watching the #FCIC10 live stream? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> Guys, is anyone else seeing this? The #FCIC10 live stream has gone dark but there’s shapes? Things moving?</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> Honestly, what’s going on? @deptofCS</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> Is everyone ok? #FCIC10</p>
<p><strong>DrKradow:</strong> @ElaineEvans A bit freaked out now. What’s happening?</p>

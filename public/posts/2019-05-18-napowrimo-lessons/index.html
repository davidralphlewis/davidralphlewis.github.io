<p>I've done NaPoWriMo for the last three years. I've found it hugely useful to create new poetry and improve my craft. The process of writing thirty poems in thirty days is not a great achievement, but it is a useful one. It highlighted a couple of things to me:</p>
<h2>Pushing Through Resistance</h2>  
<p>Each time I work on this challenge, I get sick of it. There comes a point where I feel I have nothing left to write about. This generally happens around the third week, where I have lost the initial momentum and the end seems far away.</p>
<p>This year I also struggled with the arbitrary rules I had set myself. Towards the end, they felt constricting. I was increasing the line count day by day. My poems tend to hover around 15-20 lines, so stretching them to a longer length seemed difficult. On day twenty or so, I thought that I couldn't write longer poems at all, I had lost anything I wanted to say and might as well give up.</p>
<p>As will be obvious, I didn't give up. I kept on pushing through, writing increasingly long poems until I reached the thirty lines. Some of the longer ones became my favourites.  The resistance and fear I felt were because I was pushing myself out of my comfort zone. It was something new and I didn't know how to do it. But the limits I set myself pushed me forward and helped remove the fear. No matter how good it was, I needed to get <em>x</em> number of lines written and published by the end of the day. The deadline and limits allowed me to push myself, even though they were completely self-imposed and arbituary.</p>
<h2>The power of the subconscious</h2>  
<p>Most weekdays I would write on my lunch-breaks. I only had an hour and by the time I ate and did general life business, there wasn't many minutes left to actually write. I learnt to trust my subconscious and just go with my instincts on what to write. There simply wasn't enough time to find an idea that I knew would go somewhere.</p>
<p>If I didn't have a clear idea of what to write, I would flip through my notebook, choose a phrase almost at random and just start writing around whatever it was. Before I realised it, I had a poem. Writing in this way over a number of days made me feel like I wasn't in control of the process, the writing was coming from my subconscious. It sounds strange to say but I think this is when I produced my favourite poems when I barely knew what it was I was writing about. Poetry as a form is all about the half-glimpsed images, the moments that floor you emotionally and you never quite know why. Digging in deep threw up unusual images for me. Often I would understand a poem halfway through writing it. This process can be hard as it feels like giving up control, but it is worth it. Trust your gut instincts and your feelings to guide you.</p>
<h2>Time to write</h2>  
<p>Life continued around NaPoWriMo. I started a new job and adjusted to a new life. But every day, there was always at least half an hour where I could squeeze in writing. This process has highlighted I can always write in the cracks or the quiet moments of the day, even if it's only for ten minutes.  Despite this constant impression I have of being busy, there is almost always a few minutes that can be carved out and reclaimed. And a few minutes is better than none at all.</p>
<h2>Next year</h2>  
<p>I'm going to do this again next year. The whole process is extremely beneficial to my work and always throws up interesting poems. I'm undecided about whether to post them up online next year as I may want to start sending poems out to magazines. But whatever I decide, I find it useful to exercise to work on something intensely for a month, every day.</p>

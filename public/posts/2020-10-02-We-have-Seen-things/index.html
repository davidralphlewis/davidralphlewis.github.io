<p>We have seen millions of years<br>
stacked upon another in sediment<br>
history etched into the stone,<br>
outlines and skeletons of creatures<br>
beyond imagination who used<br>
to claim this planet as their own.<br>
We have wandered far from light<br>
covered our hands in ochre dust<br>
and pressed them into the walls<br>
to leave a mark for those following.</p>
<p>We have roamed away from our home<br>
plains, seen towering trees that are<br>
the earth breathing, lakes turned to<br>
rock by angry gods, high mountains<br>
where they sit and argue our fates.</p>
<p>We have noticed the wheat rising<br>
along well worn paths and so<br>
we have pressed ears into the soil<br>
and seen how it rises yearly, light<br>
transformed into food. We have<br>
planted rows, built shelters to tend<br>
our crops and in this way we have<br>
taken control of nature and the future.</p>
<p>We have seen villages, towns and empires<br>
rise from dust and collapse back<br>
into the wind. We have seen ships<br>
defy the impossible and float on<br>
waves to other lands. We have seen faces<br>
revealed in pigment or excavated<br>
from the cool marble. We have invented<br>
codes using simple lines and have read<br>
all the myriad, longing voices of the dead.</p>
<p>We have created so much suffering.<br>
Ore raised from the ground, under<br>
heat and rage transformed into blades.<br>
Into bullets. We have claimed whole lands<br>
under fantasies of flags, considered<br>
men and women to be products and<br>
transported them across oceans,<br>
spread plagues with gifts of blankets.</p>
<p>We have seen strange machines<br>
automatons that play invented games,<br>
engines that carve up the landscape,<br>
glowing screens that transport us<br>
to other worlds. We have seen rockets<br>
blaze beyond morning, seen the sun<br>
rise over the horizon on other planets.</p>
<p>We have seen waves rise higher,<br>
fires unleashed, destroying forests,<br>
skies orange and thick with smoke,<br>
mercury rising too fast, winters no<br>
longer full of snow. We know this<br>
to be our fault as we huddle together,<br>
hoping we will be here to see more.</p>
<p>The rock under our feet tells us nothing.</p>

<p>This website's domain is my name, it's my face on the front and I type the words. It lives to promote my work and is essentially a a massive ego trip. But I saw this tweet the other day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ðŸŒŸ A challenge ðŸŒŸ</p>
<p>Who will start a blog or website and feature a writer a month and also post their own work and photos?</p>
<p>Promote yourself and other writers at the same time. Maybe youâ€™ll start an online mag (start small and keep it manageable)  ðŸ–Š ðŸ’» #gauntlet thrown down</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/blackboughpoems/status/1316511381198442498?s=03">Black Bough Poetry / Barddoniaeth Y Gangen Ddu @blackboughpoems</a>[^1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It rekindled an idea I had before- add in guest authors to write the occasional blog post. Promote other voices, not just my own. Make this website more of a conversation and less of a monologue. A bit of messing around with the back end and voila, I can add in other people. They will be clearly marked and should have a bio. If there's no author mentioned, assume its from me.</p>
<p>So from now, once a month, I'm going to try to feature other people's work. I've got no real preference for what it will be- a poem, a blogpost about writing methods, a rant, an image. Anything creative really.[^2] If you would like to have your work featured here, <a href="mailto:contact@davidralphlewis.co.uk">email me.</a></p>
<p>[^1]: They are a fantastic press that do a lot to promote other authors.
[^2]: Shouldn't need saying, but no hate speech.</p>

<p>When the earth was correcting<br>
our cabled bodies were sprawled<br>
irreparable, most sensory inputs<br>
disconnected, transmissions down,<br>
smashed by careless hands wielding<br>
boulders. When networks were down,<br>
when communities were rewiring<br>
like dust scattered in sunbeams,<br>
We stayed immobile in deserts,<br>
newly separate and confused<br>
listening to automated number<br>
stations, comfort in the night.</p>
<hr/>
Looking through my drafts recently, I realised this one was never posted. Pascal Vine was asking for prompts a while back, so I gave them the prompt "All we listened to was a number station". I wrote a response to it as well. This predates covid but feels very relevant now.

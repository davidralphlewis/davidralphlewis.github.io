<p>We are unified euphoria,<br>
one organism joined together,<br>
twitching, harmonising, swaying.</p>
<p><em>We dance with the same body.</em><br>
<em>Our heart it beats as one.</em></p>
<p>We combine to exalt the music,<br>
exalt the beat and exalt the bass,<br>
exalt our limbs, our skin, our sweat.</p>
<p><em>We dance with the same body.</em><br>
<em>Our heart it beats as one.</em></p>
<p>then my stomach lunges<br>
like a rabid dog<br>
and I remember.</p>
<p><em>We dance with the same body.</em></p>
<p>and I try to push my way out<br>
but flesh becomes a wall<br>
and I am trapped in the maze<br>
of so many warm bodies.</p>
<p><em>Our heart it beats as one.</em></p>
<p>A gentle hand of blue<br>
creeps around the blackout blind,<br>
strokes my cheek, raises goose bumps,<br>
beckons me back to another<br>
reality, another morning.<br>
I am still a dream of myself.<br>
Part of me has evaporated in the night.</p>
<p>My hand twitches for a screen<br>
yearning to download today's<br>
minor triumphs and major disasters,<br>
catastrophic headlines and pet pictures,<br>
the nauseating loop of half ideas, niche jokes,<br>
and all those graphs trending upwards.</p>
<p>I resist. I will not turn on the wifi,<br>
not just yet.  I will listen to my breath<br>
sudden and rapid, see it form and vanish<br>
a spectre in the cold. I will hear<br>
my heart play a drum solo<br>
all kick pedal and cymbals<br>
linked in complex time signatures.</p>
<p>I open the blind and the world pours in slow,<br>
a syrup of light, viscous and thick.<br>
Bare tree branches are molten.<br>
The clouds are cooling coals, glowing red.<br>
From distant, dissonant engines,<br>
the dawn chorus emerges, a beat<br>
of wing and beak, dream remnants<br>
transformed into song. I look to the telephone<br>
wires,  veins and arteries spun from gold,<br>
see how they connect us all, and I feel<br>
so many eyes stirring from sleep<br>
so many dreams flickering and fading<br>
so many hands wrapped around others<br>
or searching in the half light<br>
for someone's absent touch<br>
so many hearts synchronised without realising.</p>
<p>I plead to the chimneys: be well.<br>
Oh, please let all of us be well.</p>
<p><em>We dance with the same body.</em><br>
<em>Our heart it beats as one.</em></p>

<p>This was written for the wonderful <a href="facebook.com/BristolTonic/">Bristol Tonic.</a>, which I co-headlined last night. It was my first headlining slot ever and I was so grateful to be asked. The night has been such a warm, welcoming space to share new work and has been a lifeline during this year especially, when we are all scattered and separate. Thanks so much to them, it was an honour.</p>
<p>You can watch the night back <a href="https://www.facebook.com/881907221970150/videos/403226870869725">here.</a></p>

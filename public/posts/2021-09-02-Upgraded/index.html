<p>I have a poem up on the wonderful <em>Ink, Sweat and Tears!</em> Thanks so much to them for featuring it. It's called <em>Ceasefire</em> and is a little more grim than usual. <a href="https://inksweatandtears.co.uk/david-ralph-lewis/">Find it here</a></p>
<p>I'm glad things are opening up again. I performed at a real life open mic last week and it was glorious. The downside of actually being around people is that I caught a cold for the first time in about two years. I'm just glad it wasn't Covid.</p>

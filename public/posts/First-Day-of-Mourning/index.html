<p>Soon, they joined together in hordes<br>
of increasing size, shudders running over<br>
their bodies like waves in a storm.<br>
They sat together over the cenotaph,<br>
the shopping centre, spilled out into two<br>
lane roads, holding each other as their sobs<br>
became life rafts. Confused crowds watched,<br>
unwilling to leap over to understanding.<br>
Soon traffic stopped altogether, drivers<br>
unable to see through salt water.</p>
<p>I stared only at the buddleia and verbena.<br>
I knew they cried for the rising of the tide,<br>
a future washed away in cruelty and ignorance.<br>
Soon, I shuffled towards my air-conditioned<br>
office, swallowing the lump in my throat.</p>

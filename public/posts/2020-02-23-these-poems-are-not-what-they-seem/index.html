<p>I'm delighted to have a poem included in an anthology of poems inspired by Twin Peaks, called <em><a href="https://www.apeppublications.com/product/these-poems-are-not-what-they-seem/">These Poems are Not What They Seem,</a></em> published by APEP publications. My poem is called <em>We're gonna keep her out of it</em> and draws inspiration from Sarah Palmer and the character of Judy in the return. It's also about rumours.</p>
<p>The anthology out March 7th and is available for preorder now. It's a US publication though, so check shipping costs.</p>
<p>I also read my poem as part of Performance Anxiety, a monthly reading on skype. You can listen below. I'm the token Brit.</p>

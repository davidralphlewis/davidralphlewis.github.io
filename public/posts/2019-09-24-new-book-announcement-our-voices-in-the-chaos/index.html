<p>I'm really excited to announce my debut chapbook is being published by the fine folks over at Selcouth Station. It's called <em>Our Voices in the Chaos</em> and is a combination of blackout poems and actual poems. It's an anxious little hybrid of a book, dealing with societal collapse, ghosts and what the rain says.</p>

<p>Here's a beautiful cover designed by Stuart Buck:</p>

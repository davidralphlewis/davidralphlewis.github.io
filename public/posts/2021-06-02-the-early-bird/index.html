<p><em>CW: Very brief allusion to suicidal thoughts</em></p>
<p>The early bird catches the worm<br>
from a chain coffee shop, is rude<br>
and dismissive to the barista,<br>
pecks down the wriggling body<br>
and a double espresso before<br>
zipping off to a day of meetings<br>
and spreadsheets. The early bird<br>
meets all their deadlines, demands<br>
100 percent attendance at every meeting<br>
they organise, no excuses, blocks off<br>
time in a colour-coded, neat, hand-drawn<br>
calendar that they make every Sunday<br>
night in preparation for the week ahead.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If colleagues were asked to describe<br>
the early bird, they would use the words<br>
'brusque' or 'serious' or 'difficult to get on with'.<br>
They do not hear how fast the early bird's<br>
heart is beating, do not see how it swivels<br>
it's head all day to see what everyone else<br>
is doing. The early bird puts in long hours,<br>
is the first one into the office, the last<br>
one to leave. Exhaustion always wins though,</p>
<p>so the early bird flies under amber<br>
street lights, guided in the dark by instinct,<br>
past lurid billboards and lairy groups<br>
of men in ties, back to it's nest,<br>
empty, wedged in a tree branch in<br>
the expensive part of the city. It settles<br>
itself down into the twigs and newspaper<br>
shavings and tries to block out all<br>
the emptiness around it, wonders<br>
what would happen if it just dropped<br>
and didn't even try to open it's wings<br>
before singing itself to sleep with songs<br>
its mother taught it long ago, on another<br>
continent as it's chest flutters</p>
<p>too fast<br>
too loud.</p>

<p>If you prefer to hear me reading it out, you are in luck! Just watch this:</p>

<p>This started as a writing exercise when you try to twist a cliche and developed into something different from there.</p>

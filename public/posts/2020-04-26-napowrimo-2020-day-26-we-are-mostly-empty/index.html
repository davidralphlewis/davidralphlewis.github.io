<p>As we tumbled through the void,<br>
everything was calm and peaceful<br>
if you ignored the constant drone<br>
of spycraft. The air was pink<br>
electric and crackled with potential</p>
<p>There was something struggling<br>
within it, something hidden, unseen.</p>
<p>It shimmered in the air, made of<br>
nothing at all, blinking on and off,<br>
a broken sunbeam. It had walked for years,<br>
over burning deserts, stumbling over<br>
broken glass and sharp shingle beaches.<br>
Whispers and noises from other dimensions<br>
combined, a palimpsest of imagined voices.</p>
<p>As I surrendered, my head filled with static.<br>
I forget the boundaries between us. We<br>
became one living pulsing mass that screamed<br>
and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked.<br>
We tasted foil. We heard a great tearing of metal,<br>
groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming<br>
at each other. We saw the strings of the universe<br>
clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk.</p>

<p>Prompt was to &quot;Look back through your old writing notebooks and make a collage poem from discarded lines and free writes.&quot; from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesandsnakes/">Apples and Snakes</a>. I adjusted some for tenses and added in a few connectives, but mostly this is from my notebook. Wish I knew what this was about or what the lines meant when I wrote them down.</p>

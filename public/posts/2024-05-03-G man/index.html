<p>When asked to provide an account<br>
he spoke only in pollen drifts.</p>
<p>In the interrogation room the air<br>
was thick with drifting spores.</p>
<p>Taking this as being unco-operative<br>
the attending agent fetched freedom tools.</p>
<p>Outer leaves were sliced off to start<br>
but vines, thick and choking, grew back</p>
<p>to fill the holes left behind. He smiled.<br>
Each visible tooth a bud about to open.</p>
<p>Attempts to dislodge the subject from the chair<br>
were unsuccessful as he had rooted through<br>
the concrete floor, sending fingers deep<br>
below the complex, into the vengeful soil.</p>
<p>Insurgent! We cried, Unpatriotic betrayer!<br>
but he just laughed in swallow murmurations</p>
<p>before expanding like alliums in May,<br>
growing to grab the walls with bindweed tendrils.<br>
Shots were fired but only blooms exploded.<br>
Still, he grew, shattering the one way glass,<br>
his smile now stretching from wall to wall,<br>
his hair digging into the ceiling tile cracks.<br>
Agents Symonds and Mikowski were lost, bodies<br>
converted to compost. We sealed the bomb  doors</p>
<p>cut off section 4A, but even now the metal buckles,<br>
Even now we have teams working around the clock</p>
<p>ready with secateurs held in shaking hands<br>
watching for that first suggestion of green.</p>

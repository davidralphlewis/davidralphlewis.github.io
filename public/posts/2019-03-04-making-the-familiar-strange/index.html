<p>I though I was a good typist. I've written on computers all my life. I type fast. But the truth is half my time is spent correcting errors. I write fast but sloppy. So I started to learn to touch type.</p>
<p>I tried to learn a few years ago but only got half way through learning, not committing to the practice. As a result, my typing is a weird hybrid of hunt and peck and formal touch typing. I didn't practise enough to embed the muscle memory. So I started again from the beginning. I expect to breeze through the first few lessons but struggled as I relearnt my familiar method. I still struggle with it now, a few weeks in. This skill that had felt so familiar now felt strange and difficult.</p>
<p>It affected my writing as well. The effect of slowing down and making the familiar skill strange meant I thought a lot more about the words I wrote, the construction of sentences and the rhythm of my words. It was a similar effect to<a href="s/power-of-paper/"> writing by hand. </a></p>
<p>We place too much effort on the routine and regularity of writing.  Of course, we need regular times to get the words written. Sometimes it does need to become rote as otherwise long pieces simply wouldn't get done. bUt I think it's equally as important to remind yourself that just because you've been doing something the same way for ages, doesn't mean it's necessarily the best way to do it. These times between projects are the perfect breathing space to figure out how to change this.</p>
<p>I also think it's a chance to see the world anew. You make the process strange and in do in doing so, change the way you see the world. Maybe we need more of this. See the world with fresh eyes and make the familiar strange, so we can figure out how to make it better.<br /></p>

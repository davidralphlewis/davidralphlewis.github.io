<p>Given the kindness and cruelty of time,<br>
a majority forgot those years where<br>
the tilt of the earth increased. Only<br>
a degree. Or more. Scientists spoke,<br>
we didn't listen, lost in our own panic,<br>
sick with adrenaline. Maybe others<br>
were able to convince themselves<br>
by repetition: It wasn't that bad. We<br>
pulled together. It wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>What they omit is the months of still<br>
night, a numbness that never left,<br>
the dread- this situation was static,<br>
we had buried our normality with axes<br>
under the ice floes that spread arms<br>
down from the north, over city towers,<br>
consuming mountains, farms and futures.<br>
A new ice age. Mostly I woke, limbs numb,<br>
wondering how I would endure the day.</p>
<p>I always did. And given enough days,<br>
even the glaciers melted and receded,<br>
leaving behind new altered landscapes,<br>
sun painted gifts for our patience.</p>

<p>Prompt was to &quot;Write a poem including the words ‘forgot’, ‘maybe’ and ‘tilt’&quot; from the Poetry in the Time of Being Alone Group</p>

<p><em>After Aphex Twin</em></p>
<p>All I conjure is the vertigo of ancient cliffs<br>
while listening to voices from the radiator,<br>
muffled sentences- 'rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb'<br>
they murmur, a bad tv play. I clutch a hanky,<br>
concentrating on horizontal tree roots, the grass<br>
clinging to granite. I try not to think of the mold<br>
that grows logarithmically behind the curtains.<br>
My future is a distant ocean below, a grey blur.<br>
What is my life compared to weathered stone?<br>
Already my fingertips are mutating into blue calx,<br>
already my forehead is developing parallel stripes<br>
of strata. The decay inevitable, like shiny metal rods<br>
over thousands of years. This house will be a grey strip<br>
soon, our dwelling marked only by a mutated 'z' twig<br>
growing in the cracks. Look, how worn the windowsill<br>
is already. I sigh to the silence, tracing a hexagon<br>
in dust. This world is not ours, it is owned by lichen,<br>
ours is only the shadow. We see reality in spots,<br>
in all those neglected corners, on the damp tassels<br>
of curtains. My body is indistinct, only a blur too,<br>
edges forgotten, bones crumbling to matchsticks.</p>

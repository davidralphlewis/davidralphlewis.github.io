<p>This was written in an Apples and Snakes Red Sky Sessions. It started as a response to a poem by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCy9YS_UYeE">Hannah Silva</a>. We then composed by voice, speaking into our phones. I got stuck on the found text aspect of Hannah's work and ended up repeating loads of politician's phrases. We then turned it into a poem, so I went to the other extreme and turned it into this.</p>
<p>The Red Sky sessions have been so valuable, so in depth and fantastic to spark off ideas. I have a lot of new directions to go in. Thanks so much to Apples and Snakes for running them.</p>

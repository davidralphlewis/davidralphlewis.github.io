<p><em>After Kay Ryan</em></p>
<p>She's silent, stiff. You drum fingers<br>
on pressed linen. The waiter brings<br>
red wine. Only one glass. Your mind<br>
is filled with dust spirals and wind.<br>
You order steak, but she doesn't eat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You try a joke, get the punchline wrong,<br>
and she does not laugh. She is smiling.<br>
Always smiling. This isn't going well,<br>
you say to yourself. Flustered, you knock<br>
your glass. Scarlet seeps into cream.</p>
<p>She does not mind. She isn't here.<br>
Hasn't been for years now.</p>

<p>I'm taking part in the Red Sky Sessions run by Apples and Snakes. It's a five week program focusing on writing poetry. In the first session we read <a href="https://poets.org/poem/niagara-river">this poem</a> by Kay Ryan and were asked to write a poem backwards. Starting at the end and writing the rest of the poem above it. So of course I went for a Twilight Zone style ending.</p>
<p>I'm not going to do #napowrimo publicly this month, which is a shame. I just don't have the capacity to publish every day. But I'm still going to try and write lots of poems.</p>

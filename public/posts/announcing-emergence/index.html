<p>A few years ago, I stumbled on an article about the idea of panpsychicism where consciousness is a part of everything. In this theory, the face we can think and dream is an emergent property of the universe itself. I'm not sure I fully believe this theory, but something about it stuck with me.</p>
<p>Now, three or four year later I've written a little poetry pamphlet around the theme. It's called <em>Emergence</em> and has twenty poems dealing with the thoughts and dreams of atoms, hives, humans and the cosmos. Writing the poems was also an excuse to experiment with form, so I had fun with formatting the poems to reflect the content. It's very much a project that needs to be on the page. I've enjoyed creating a physical book after making <a href="https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments">Reality Adjustments.</a></p>
<p>Here's the cover:</p>

<p>A huge thanks to <a href="https://linktr.ee/barryhollow">Barry Hollow</a> and <a href="https://linktr.ee/StanleyIyanu">Stanley Iyanu</a> who read a previous version of the pamphlet and gave feedback. It's taken a long time to get to the final stage and they both helped me clarify and edit the sprawling mess of poems.</p>
<p>It's available to pre order now <a href="https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/product/emergence">here</a>. It costs Â£7 plus postage, with 30 copies available. I hope to ship them out by 12th September.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

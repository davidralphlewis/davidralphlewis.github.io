<h2>Rewritten</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  
<p>Eyes flicker and head reels.<br />  
I am lost and dizzy from<br />  
another reality adjustment.<br />  
Precious seconds to get my bearings,<br />  
probing my memory for gaps,<br />  
a tongue checking missing teeth.</p>  
<p>A nerve twitches, a sign of change.<br />  
Last Tuesday no longer existed.<br />  
Not the worst to reconcile,<br />  
nothing of great importance lost.<br />  
Perhaps just a rainy day gone,<br />  
work, tv and cups of tea.</p>  
<p>Whole months have been deleted before,<br />  
years when they were inconvenient.<br />  
We accepted them without protest<br />  
not often knowing what we lost.</p>  
<p>The subtle, gentle changes are hard-<br />  
rain when you swore it was sun.<br />  
Physics changing. The bullet<br />  
landing there, not here.</p>  
<p>Most stopped caring about politics.<br />  
We became numb and did not register if<br />  
a speech's reception was edited<br />  
or some minister altered a few votes.<br />  
These are the days of constant whiplash<br />  
and rising nausea. No, we mourn the <br />  
quiet moments most. Holding hands<br />  
deemed subversive and forgotten<br />  
or our laughter changed to silence. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

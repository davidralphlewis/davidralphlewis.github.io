<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Good afternoon, you're through to Julia. How can I help you?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It's all so bright.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>So bright!</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>You're on the technical live chat. Is there an issue I can help you with?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It's broken.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>What is?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Make it stop.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok, I am here to help you.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Make it stop!</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I will endeavour to help you as much as possible.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I understand it is difficult.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It is-</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>But I need you to describe the problem to me.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yes, sorry. It's just... it's too much, you know?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>You do?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I do. It’s overwhelming.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Ok, right.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Are you still there?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I am. Sorry.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>What's the problem?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It's my stimplant. It's broken.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>OK sorry to hear that. Sometimes there are defects, but here at Phaethon we do our best to eliminate them. How can I help?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>The man in the shop never said this would happen. He lied to me.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>OK, which shop?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It was ages ago, I can't remember. He lied to me though. He said I would be safe. Why would he lie to me? That's not fair.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>So it isn't responding at all?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Nothing but darkness.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Do you know how lost I feel? How alone and alien? I had to dig out my old computer to make this call. I couldn't just dial you up in my head like usual. There was no friendly voice to reassure me. The world was so dark and quiet. I had forgotten about the endless night.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>That doesn't sound good.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I didn't even think you would still have a live chat. I thought these sorts of things died ages ago.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>We maintain the service for times like this.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I'm glad you do. I don't know what to do. How to fix it. Why does the world look like this? It's horrible. What we’ve done to the planet. No wonder everyone has a stimplant.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>We do have some customers who don't have stimplants as well.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Indeed. So we maintain this line for them.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Wow</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>How old fashioned.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>We believe in giving our customers choice.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Urgh. I don’t know how they cope. To constantly look at that dark sky. This has been broken for half an hour and I’m struggling.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok, so it happened half an hour ago?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Can you describe what happened?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I can try.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I was involved in my favourite soap. I was watching the action from the corner of the room. Some people prefer to move about the set but I guess I'm a bit old fashioned and prefer to stay in one place you know?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>However you prefer to enjoy the stim-casts is up to you.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Thanks. I like that though. Got into a routine with it.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>So you were using the stimplant in full immersion mode?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That's right. In my room.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Then what happened?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I had just got to the part where Jazz was about to admit to her affair with Rob, when she stopped. I thought it was a dramatic pause at first so I waited it out. After a couple of moments I thought, no something is wrong here. So I moved around the scene. They were frozen, completely frozen in place. Then Rob's face started to melt and I thought, that's not right that, it seemed really wrong, then there was this terrible noise that split my head, like a screech or something but more electronic.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Then my whole vision went black. It was like falling asleep or something, but without the usual relaxing music from the stimplant. It was like being disconnected from all of reality. Then I opened my eyes and I was sat in my chair in my shitty bedsit. There was nothing around me, no usual heads up information. I didn't even know the time. More than that, all my usual filters were gone. No SummerSun™. No Beautyify™. Even no TidyMeUp™. So it all felt a bit overwhelming. Sorry if I was disoriented when I spoke to you, it's just that I'm not used to reality unfiltered like that.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Right OK. So it just went black?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That's right. Was this what the world was like before the stims? I can't remember how I ever got on without it.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Yes, it was.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It's awful. Who would want to live in reality?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Well, people didn't have any choice.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I guess not. Still, it's horrible. Urgh. So dark and cold.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok, I'm going to have to remotely access the stimplant. Would that be OK?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I need you to type &quot;I agree to Phaethon Lab having remote access to my Stimplant.&quot;</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Ok.
I agree to Phaethon Lab having remote access to my Stimplant.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I'm just accessing it now.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Do you know what's in my bedsit?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>If I get it working I'm sure I’ll be able to see.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Just a shitty bed, a cabinet and a bathroom off to one side. That's it. My whole life fits in here. It's pathetic.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Okay, accessing it now.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I've wasted my life in a fantasy world. Sure, there’s no sun anymore, but at least it’s real life you know?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Let's see if I can get it back up and running.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Oooh. That tingles!</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Can you tell me what you're experiencing?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I have pins and needles all down my neck.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>They are really quite intense.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Like, almost painful. Is that meant to be happening?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>My apologies for the inconvenience. How about now?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That's better, they've gone.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Good. I'm just adjusting some settings.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>How did I end up here? The stimplant was only meant to be something I used occasionally. Now I never emerge from it.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>How about now?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Now my whole vision is shades of red.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Red? Are you sure?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yes, definitely red.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Is that right?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>No, it should not be doing that.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>No need to panic.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Ok?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I just need to adjust a few settings.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>How about now?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That’s better.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Has it stopped?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Vision back to normal?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I'm just checking a few things.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>What sort of things?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Julia? Are you there?</p>
<p>...
It's cold here. My room is so drab and grey. There’s no light outside.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Apologies for the delay. OK, I've just tried a manual override and no luck.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Oh.<br>
Right.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>That means your stimplant has unfortunately, seriously malfunctioned.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>You will need to report directly to the nearest Phaethon shop, where you will be administered a general anaesthetic and the stimplant will be taken out.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>It hurt so much last time.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>They have improved the procedure.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Nah, I don't want it.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I'm sorry?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I know my room is cold and drab. I know it's horrible and tiny and there’s no sun any more and that sucks for sure. I'm freezing for the first time in ages. My skin has goosebumps all over it. Tiny little pinpricks all over my skin. From here, I can see outside my window. Yes, it's mostly smog. Yes, I can’t see a lot in the darkness. But it's there. The whole world, spread out in front of my window. It's not perfect at all. Nothing is. But it's real. It makes a change to experience reality, unfiltered. I was scared at first, but that is because I wasn't used to it. I've got more used to it now. I want to feel the wind on my skin. That's what I want now. So no, I'm not going to get a new stimplant. I'm going to experience reality for the first time in years.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Ok. Does it help that you will be able to get the latest model for a nominal payment of £50?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>£50?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>As a loyal, long-term customer of Phaethon Labs I can arrange a credit for you.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>No, thank you.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>The newest model has new software with the highest resolution and clarity.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I'm not interested. I want to go and experience the world as it really is. I want to be free from distraction for the first time in years.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>There are new filters.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Oh yes, a whole new range of experiences. The technology has come a long way since you had your stimplant put in. You want to feel the wind? This is indistinguishable from the real wind. Better in many ways.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Only £50 did you say?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>For the newest model of stimplant, yes.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>The newest model did you say?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>The newest model.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Wow. Um. I mean. I guess reality can wait.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Are you sure?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Yeah, for £50 I’d be a fool not to.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I had the stimplant up to this point, didn't I? I'm sure I can carry on with it.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Great. After all, you wouldn't want to miss out.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>I wouldn't want to miss out on the latest technology would I?</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>I can book an appointment for you in the next half an hour.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Um.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ok then.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Great, that's all sorted for you. I've sent the details by email.</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>Was that it?</p>
<p>ALI</p>
<p>That’s it. You've been very helpful.</p>
<p>JULIA</p>
<p>No problem. We at Phaethon Labs hope you have a wonderful day.</p>

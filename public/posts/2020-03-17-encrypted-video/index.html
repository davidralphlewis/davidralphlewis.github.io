<p>Social isolation means I'm working through the backlog of things I have to do. So I uploaded this video of my poem <em>Encrypted,</em> which was kindly shot by Chris at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic">Bristol Tonic,</a> one of the best nights around to encourage new writing.</p>
<p>Each month performers get given a prompt and are asked to make a piece in a month. My prompt was &quot;Threw postcards in the shape of airplanes hoping they get to where they meant to.&quot; That's a great prompt.</p>
<p>I took it in some strange directions. Chris also helped me record an audio version of it which was featured on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07xtgyr">BBC Upload</a> on BBC Radio Bristol.</p>

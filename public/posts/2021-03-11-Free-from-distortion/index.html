<p>Taken from a old <em>New Yorker</em>, no idea which issue.</p>
<p>A few bits of news:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I made a really strange puzzle page for the latest issue of <a href="https://www.welcometobearcreek.com/puzzles"><em>Welcome to Bear Creek</em></a>. Thanks so much to them. The whole issue is strange and beautiful, go check it out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sam Cavender (who shot the headshot on my home page) took this crazy UV portrait of me in a park. (We were socially distant at all times.) He is an actual wizard:</p>

<p>Check out his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/samsnapsalot/">photography here.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I've been reading out my pamphlet <a href="/refractionpamphlet"><em>Refraction</em></a> over on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis">Instagram</a>. It's been a lot of fun! I've enjoyed revisiting the poems and making something new out of them. I've also released the pdf for free. <a href="/refractionpamphlet">Download it here.</a></li>

<p>It's free but if you want to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis">buy me a coffee</a> it would be much appreciated, but is by no means essential.</p>
<p>If you prefer a physical version, I've got a handful of copies left if you want one, available at my <a href="https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com">shop.</a> Thanks to everyone who has bought one so far.</p>

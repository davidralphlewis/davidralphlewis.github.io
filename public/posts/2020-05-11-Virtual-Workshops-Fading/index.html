<p>I joined a virtual poetry workshop yesterday run by the wonderful <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic">Tonic</a> and wrote this:</p>

<h2>Fading</h2>
<p>Singing soft chimes under her breath, she<br>
kisses each ear of wheat, borrows<br>
yellow from sunflower petals before</p>
<p>smearing each cloud with evening, takes<br>
indigo from the blackberries, then stops,<br>
not satisfied with her canvas. Sighing, she<br>
grabs a cherry blossom and erases the day<br>
showing the countless stars behind, waiting.</p>
<p>It was an acrostic and pastoral workshop. Working within those constraints was really challenging but really useful. By limiting myself, it challenged the language and patterns I usually fall into when making poetry.</p>
<p>One of the very few advantages of lockdown has been the proliferation of live streamed poetry events. It means I've been able to attend a few more than I would do normally and from a wider area. I took part in an online slam the other day with the hosts based in Swindon, which would be too far for me to go for a night in oridnary life.</p>
<p>It's a bitter blessing. Nothing beats being in a room with other people but this is the next best thing.</p>

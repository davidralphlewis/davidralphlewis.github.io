<p>I've made a couple of my self published books free to download.<br />There's <em><a href="/amberstars/">Amber Stars: One Night of Stories</a></em>, which is my first book of linked stories and <em><a href="/remainvigilant/">Remain Vigilant</a></em> which is two one act plays in the same world. <em><a href="/aprilfog/">Lost in April Fog</a></em>, my Napowrimo poems from 2018 was free before but I've offered direct links and removed the need to go through the shop. All are in PDF, Mobi (for Kindles) and ePub (for everything else).<br /><br />All the books have now been changed to Creative Commons licences so feel free to distribute and remix them if you so wish.<br /><br />I've seen a few people offer up free books during the pandemic. I've wanted to do this for a little while, so this was the prompting I needed. They will all remain free after as well, this isn't a limited time thing.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>So we're socially isolated for the foreseeable. It's a weird time, but I've been amazed by how people are being incredibly generous. There is so much kindness out there from everyone despite the uncertainty. Here are some things I've come across that you may enjoy while distancing from others that may help you feel connected or entertained.</p>
<h2>Poetry</h2>  
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/storygiverpoet">Sam Grudgings</a> is doing <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uky4OqiU17Ny0epIvgYWDB7Z8b5dInJu">a weekly newsletter</a> of poetry in order to combat loneliness and forge connections with others. It's a lovely idea, find it here:</p>
<p><a href="https://linktr.ee/PascalVpoet">Pascal Vine</a> has shared a long playlist of excellent live poetry. Find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BdEg1nePfL8Qt2KosX0FdUjW7s71jUu">it here</a>.</p>
<p>Outspoken Press have made their excellent <a href="http://www.outspokenldn.com/shop?category=EBOOKS">poetry book collection</a> free until the end of 20th March- I recommend Joelle Taylor and Raymond Antrobus.</p>
<p>Stuart Buck has a free micro collection of poems called <a href="https://www.rhythmnbone.com/fuck-the-apocalypse"><em>Fuck the Apocalypse.</em></a></p>
<h2>Other stuff</h2>  
<p>Some lovely relaxing music from <a href="https://archivesdubmusic.bandcamp.com/album/home">Warmth</a>, appropriately titled *HomeÂ *is now pay what you want.</p>
<p>Cosmic Shambles are running <a href="http://cosmicshambles.com/stayathome">a series of streamed gigs</a> with excellent comedians. if you don't already listen to <em>Book Shambles</em> with Robin Ince and Josie Liong, you really should be.</p>
<p>Also called Stay at Home fest, <a href="https://www.stayathomefest.com/">this site</a> collects live music and has a community calendar for other live-streamed events.</p>
<p>2000AD are offering an ebook of <a href="https://2000ad.com/news/free-to-download-400-pages-of-epic-judge-dredd/">Judge Dredd</a> for free.</p>

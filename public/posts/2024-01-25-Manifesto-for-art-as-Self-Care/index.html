<p>I've been thinking a lot about creative 'rules' and how arbituary they are. As it's the new year, I've been wondering where I want to take my poetry and my creativity and have decided I want to do it for its own sake. I want to focus more on the wellbeing aspects of writing and making things rather than the end result.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some principles for art as self care:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Engage with a wide range of cool art from cool people. Follow your curiosity but also seek out new things and works you aren't aware of.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share what you like and write why. If you don't like things, make private notes to yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use paper for thinking and playing, use screens for editing and refining.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a very small daily practise -less than five minutes. This could be a haiku or a quick sketch. Try to do it daily but don't beat yourself up if you don't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observe the world around you as much as possible. Concentrate on your senses. Write or sketch. Pull from these archives when stuck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embrace <em>what if</em>. Play with ideas and approaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other artists have already made paths. Follow them for a while then branch off on your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek collaborators and opportunities, not publicity or clout.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spend some time editing and refining your work, not to get it perfect but to see what happens if you improve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create for the commons. All art is an ongoing conversation, so publish with wild abandon. Remember it's no longer yours once it's been released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't take comments to heart unless you trust the person and actively seek out their feedback.</p>
</li>
</ol>

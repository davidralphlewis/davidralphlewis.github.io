<p><em>This a new series where I interview poets about their process and writing in reference to a single poem. Today we have Pauline Sewards, a fantastic poet I met through her night</em> Satellite of Love. *I'd urge you to buy  <em>Today we are discussing one of the poems from her debut collection.</em> Spirograph, <em>published by</em> Burning Eye books.</p>

<h2>Pride</h2>
<p>Mary says she didn't know what a rainbow flag was<br>
until a woman with a glorious voice raised one at the Albert Hall.</p>
<p>She said she was just a fat queer from Kansas, Mary says<br>
with love and wonder in her voice.</p>
<p>Like all of Mary's conversations this is repeated a lot,<br>
like turns of a hamster wheel over and over</p>
<p>She couples it with the comments that made her feel sick,<br>
complaints of bias by 'appalled', 'outraged' and 'offended'</p>
<p>who hated the way jingoism at the Prom was tempered<br>
by music titled 'Woke' and 'For Democracy'</p>
<p>hated most that tiny smiling woman who enunciated every syllable<br>
and opened her scarlet mouth to let her voice out on wings.</p>
<p>Mary says she knows what Blake meant when he wrote 'Jerusalem'<br>
that it isn't for the Union Jacks and the Brexiters<br>
She calls him William Morris by mistake, but she's utterly sincere.</p>
<p>Repeats herself so much, can hardly get out of her sitting room,<br>
where not a lot happens except on TV.<br>
Mary's granddaughter thinks she repeats her stories<br>
because they are telling something she can't directly say.</p>
<p>A memory of when news was whispered adult conversations,<br>
valve radios broadcasting sonorous voices,<br>
rumours of Kristallnacht and jackboots, gas masks, blackout curtains,<br>
screeching sirens, spitfires crossing miles of sky.</p>
<p>As leaves fall from the trees,<br>
Mary watches the Prom with her granddaughter.<br>
A vase of gladioli comes into bloom like lipstick flowers,<br>
and Jamie Barton hits that high note,<br>
somewhere over the rainbow.</p>

<p><em>D- This poem is a vivid portrait of Mary. What inspired you to write about her?</em></p>
<p>P- She is an older person who doesn’t conform to stereotypes. I liked her ability to be moved by the singer’s voice and to be curious about the rainbow flag.</p>
<p><em>D- Yes and the poem is full of detail about her. How long did you take from meeting her to writing about her- was it an instant idea or did it take a bit longer?</em></p>
<p>P- Fairly instant, I redrafted the poem a few times and took it to the stanza group I belong to for comments. The group is always helpful and perceptive.</p>
<p><em>D- What changed when you were redrafting?</em></p>
<p>P- In this poem it was mainly the syntax. Trying to express the ideas in a less clumsy way. Issues such as  tenses, time and punctuation are definitely my weak points and it helps to discuss with others.</p>
<p><em>D- Did you know it was going to be part of your collection when you wrote it?</em></p>
<p>P- I think so. But it was mainly written to celebrate Mary and a particular time in her life.</p>
<p><em>D- It definitely does that! Has Mary read or heard it?</em></p>
<p>P- Interesting question. I haven’t shown it to her. She is less fictionalised than some of the people I’ve written about. I may show her one day.</p>
<p>I always think that when I write about people I’m actually writing about my reaction to them, which makes it acceptable. I hope so. When I write about people I’ve met through work it is never a direct account and it would be a mixture of several people, so a fictional creation.</p>
<p><em>D- That's really interesting and a different  approach. Is writing this poem different to your usual process then, as you didn't fictionalise her as much?</em></p>
<p>P- I think there is a continuum of writing about real people and keeping it more distant. Redrafting is often part of that. An important aspect of Mary that I haven’t mentioned yet is her sense of history and the uncomfortable parallels between her childhood and the rise of the far right today. I think that’s buried in the poem.</p>
<p><em>D- Yes I can see that, especially with the title which could be either the pride flag or the right wing nationalism, and the echoes of the way in that penultimate stanza.</em></p>
<p><em>Have any other interpretations come up since you wrote it, especially in the different context of your collection?</em></p>
<p>P- Mainly that the rainbow flag became a popular symbol in 2020 whereas in 2019 it was primarily a powerful symbol of queerness. I like that I couldn’t have predicted that when I wrote the poem. Sadly the concerns re right wing nationalism haven’t changed, although Mary will be jubilant about US election result.</p>
<p><em>D- Thanks so much for your answers and attention! It's been really great</em></p>
<p>P- Thanks David for your great questions and giving me this space to chat!</p>

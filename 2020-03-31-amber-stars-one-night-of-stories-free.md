<p>Spend a Saturday night in Tolwood, a small town somewhere in England. Have a night on the tiles, making sure to avoid the packs of lads hunting for fights and serious banter. Swing by the Phoenix, where one repressed teenager struggles with her first night out and the DJ plays a swan song.</p>

<p>If night-life isn't your thing, why not stay in? In the town and its surrounding villages, a dinner party turns sour as ladies try a s√©ance. A man chains himself to a tree, thinking he can see all of nature, and a squabble over a parking space spins rapidly out of control.</p>
<p>This is my debut collection of short stories. It's a darkly funny look at the different characters out when the sun goes down.</p>

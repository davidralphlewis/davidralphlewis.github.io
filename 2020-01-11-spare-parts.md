Created in collaboration with M. Amelia Eikli, <em>Spare Parts</em> is a small chapbook combining flash fiction and visual poetry. Amelia wrote flash fiction around the theme of what is missing. I then took her original stories and transformed them into blackout poems. Printed side by side, the twelve poems alter and compliment the meaning of the stories. Exploring themes of loss, this is a unique experimental pamphlet.

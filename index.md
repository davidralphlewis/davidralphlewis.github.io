I'm a poet and short story writer based in Bristol, UK, whose work has been nominated for the Forward Prize and has appeared in *Neon Magazine*, *Nine Muses Poetry* and *Marble Poetry*. My first poetry chapbook, *[Our Voices in the Chaos](/ourvoicesinthechaos/)*, was published by Selcouth Station in October 2019. I self published a second tiny pamphlet in October 2020 called *[Refraction.](https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/product/refraction)*

I have a number of other books available, including three that are free to download. [Go here](/mybooks/) to browse and download. On this website, I maintain a blog about writing, art and politics as well as any other random topic. Often I scrawl over newspapers to create erasure poetry.

When not writing, I enjoy dancing badly at gigs, attempting to grow vegetables and taking photos. I understand a very, very small amount of what is going on in the world.

You can follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/davidralphlewis" rel="me">Twitter</a>, [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/davidralphlewis) and & Goodreads if you want.

Or you can <a href="mailto:contact@davidralphlewis.co.uk" rel="me">contact me here.</a> I'm available for readings, commissions or anything else.

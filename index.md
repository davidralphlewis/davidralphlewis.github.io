I'm a poet and short story writer based in Bristol, UK, whose work has appeared in *Neon Magazine*, *Nine Muses Poetry* as well as the *Lies, Dreaming* podcast. My first poetry chapbook, *[Our Voices in the Chaos](/ourvoicesinthechaos/)*, was published by Selcouth Station in October 2019. I have a number of other books available, including three that are free to download. Please see the menu above. On this website, I maintain a blog about writing, art and politics as well as any other random topic. Often I scrawl over newspapers to create erasure poetry

When not writing, I enjoy dancing badly at gigs, attempting to grow vegetables and taking photos. I understand a very, very small amount of what is going on in the world.

            <a class="post-link" href="/jekyll/update/2020/05/09/welcome-to-jekyll.html">Welcome to Jekyll!</a><p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>

photographs left on a windowsill.  <br />
That’s the hope. The numbers will  <br />
blur, the weeks will drain of detail   <br />
and colour and I will be left with  <br />
outlines and vague shapes, glimpses  <br />
of faces in the washed-out clouds,  <br />
voices speaking through the hiss.</p>

<p>But I’ll remember the constant dread  <br />
every time the radio cut to a bulletin,  <br />
how the cruelty of those in charge was  <br />
too obvious to ignore. I’ll remember  <br />
watching the trees bloom with wonder,  <br />
asking myself how beauty could still  <br />
emerge around us. I’ll remember the sun  <br />
stroking our faces despite everything,  <br />
warming us before starting on the slow  <br />
obliteration, over-exposing our thoughts.</p>

<hr />

<p>Final prompt was “What Will you Remember?” from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/">AmyKayPoetry</a>. I’ve tried to avoid writing directly about the crisis as thousands have said many wise and helpful things. With this prompt, it felt appropriate to address it.</p>

<p>I’m done! Thanks for all your support in this</p>

I’ve drunk ten espressos and all I can hear<br />
is the thumping house beat of my heart or<br />
like I am dust in the depths of the galaxy<br />
not yet ready to coalesce into planets.<br />
You must know what I mean. It’s like I’m<br />
a beam of light shot through a prism,<br />
or my thoughts are cryptic crossword clues<br />
or I’m a CRT television stuck between<br />
channels, half images looping back over<br />
themselves. What I’m trying to say is<br />
I’m like a lizard darting across hot<br />
sands, it’s like I’m caught in a washing<br />
machine near the end of the cycle, like<br />
I’ve become a comet entering the atmosphere<br />
before inevitably burning, disintegrating,<br />
becoming nothing more than fine ash rain.</p>

broken glass and sharp shingle beaches.<br />
Whispers and noises from other dimensions<br />

I forget the boundaries between us. We<br />
became one living pulsing mass that screamed<br />
and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked.<br />

groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming<br />
at each other. We saw the strings of the universe<br />
clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk.</p>

<p>Prompt was to “Look back through your old writing notebooks and make a collage poem from discarded lines and free writes.” from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesandsnakes/">Apples and Snakes</a>.

If opened, the room will fill with brine,<br />
the house as well, the streets of this<br />

sink down to rest on the carpet below.</p>

<p>I probably wouldn’t open that door either.<br />

to another door, which leads to a short<br />
corridor, leading to yet another door-<br />
you get my point. After weeks you may<br />
turn back, to be faced with the same<br />
endless recursion of impossible doors.</p>

<p>That’s where I store my collection of<br />
nebulae and black holes, that one there<br />
leads straight to the hurricane hangar.</p>

<p>Only the last one is out of bounds,<br />
the wooden door a foot high, there<br />
above the skirting board in the corner.<br />
I keep the key around my neck on a chain.<br />
It’s alarmed, but you wouldn’t know it.<br />
That’s where I keep my worries. Inside,<br />
a cupboard of ink-stained shadows,<br />
paper torn into confetti, a whistling,<br />
quiet and high, with no visible origin.</p>

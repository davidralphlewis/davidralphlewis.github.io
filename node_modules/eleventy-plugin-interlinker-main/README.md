# Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin


I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) to draft my posts before they are published on PhotoGabble. One feature of #Obsidian that I love is interlinking between notes and being able to see the connectivity graph of each note.

In January 2023 I wrote about how I [added Wiki Links support to Eleventy.js](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/noteworthy/adding-wiki-links-to-11ty/) and in doing so this plugin was borne. It has since been updated to include support for Obsidians [embedding files](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files).

## Install

```bash
npm i @photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker
```

## Configuration

```ts
type EleventyPluginInterlinkOptions = {
  // defaultLayout is the optional default layout you would like
  // to use for wrapping your embeds.
  defaultLayout?: string,

  // defaultLayoutLang is the optional default engine(s) used to render
  // your embed layout. This defaults to your 11ty project default for
  // the embed source file; typically: liquid,md.
  defaultLayoutLang?: string,

  // layoutKey is the front-matter value used for a per embed
  // template, if found it will replace defaultLayout for
  // that embed. This will always default to `embedLayout`.
  layoutKey?: string,

  // layoutTemplateLangKey is the front-matter value used for setting the
  // layout engine(s) to render the embed's layout. This defaults to your
  // 11ty project default for the embed source file; typically: liquid,md.
  layoutTemplateLangKey?: string,

  // unableToLocateEmbedFn is invoked when an embed is unable
  // to be found, this is normally due to a typo in the
  // slug that you are using. This defaults to a function
  // that returns [UNABLE TO LOCATE EMBED].
  unableToLocateEmbedFn?: ErrorRenderFn,

  // slugifyFn is used to slugify strings. If a function
  // isn't set then the default 11ty slugify filter is used.
  slugifyFn?: SlugifyFn
}
```

## Usage
In your Eleventy config file (defaults to .eleventy.js):

```js
module.exports = (eleventyConfig) => {
  eleventyConfig.addPlugin(
    require('@photogabble/eleventy-plugin-interlinker'),
    {
      defaultLayout: 'layouts/embed.liquid'
    }
  );
};
```

### Internal Links / Wikilinks

This plugin will now parse all Wiki Links formatted for example, `[[Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin]]` appears as [Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin](https://photogabble.co.uk/projects/eleventyjs-interlink-plugin/).

Using the vertical bar (`|`) you can change the text used to display a link. This can be useful when you want to work a link into a sentence without using the title of the file, for example: `[[Eleventy.js Interlink Plugin|custom display text]]` appears as [custom display text](https://www.photogabble.co.uk/projects/eleventyjs-interlink-plugin/).

> NOTE: By default this plugin will use the `title` front-matter attribute of your pages or one of the aliases (as detailed below).

### Aliases

Aliases provide you a way of referencing a file using different names, use the `aliases` property in your font matter to list one or more aliases that can be used to reference the file from a Wiki Link. For example, you might add _AI_ as an alias of a file titled _Artificial Intelligence_ which would then be linkable via `[[AI]]`.

### Linking to Pagination generated pages

A common use of pagination in 11ty is [pagination of an object](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/pagination/#paging-an-object) or data file, by default these generated pages aren't included in the all pages collection and therefore are invisible to this plugin unless you set `addAllPagesToCollections: true`.

Once done you will also need to set the title of each generated page so that this plugin can reference them, that can be done with `eleventyComputed` for example:

```yaml
---
pagination:
  data: collections.lists
  size: 1
  alias: list
  addAllPagesToCollections: true
permalink: "{{ list.permalink }}"
folder: lists
eleventyComputed:
  title: "{{ list.title }}"
---
```

### Embedding

Embedding files allows you to reuse content across your website while tracking what pages have used it.

To embed a file add an exclamation mark (`!`) in front of any wiki link for example: `![Artificial Intelligence]`. The embedded file will be rendered using 11ty's Template Engine. If you have defined a default embedding layout through `defaultLayout` or the page being embedded has front matter keyed as `layoutKey` then the embed will be rendered wrapped with the discovered template.

For example, with the default `layoutKey` your front matter might look like:

```yaml
---
embedLayout: 'layouts/bookmark-embed.liquid'
---
```

When embedding that page its data and content will be injected in to `layouts/bookmark-embed.liquid`, rendered and replace the embed declaration.

#### Inline Embeds

When rendering each embed this plugin will use the template engine as set on the file being embedded.

For most 11ty projects this defaults to `liquid,md`. The Markdown parser will wrap any inline html elements in a pair of `<p>` tags which may not be what you want to happen, especially if your using the embed inline within a paragraph of text. To overcome this you may define which template language(s) should be used to compile the embed layout by using front matter keyed as `layoutTemplateLangKey`.

For example, you might have a folder of bookmarks that you would like to embed into other pages as inline links, your `bookmarks.11tydata.js` might look like the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  embedLayout: 'layouts/bookmark-embed.liquid',
  embedLayoutLanguage: 'liquid',
}
```

This will disable the Markdown parser for the defined `embedLayout` resulting in the correct behaviour for inline embeds.

### Back Links

A backlink for a page is a link from another page to that page; this plugin tracks all backlinks through either embedding or internal wikilinks. This data is made available to your page via its `backlinks` data value.

You can then display this information in any way you would like, I use the below snippet the result of which you can see in most pages on PhotoGabble.

```twig
{% if backlinks.length > 0 %}
    <nav>
        <h3>Linking here</h3>
        <ul>
            {% for link in backlinks %}
                <li><a href="{{ link.url }}">{{ link.title }}</a></li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ul>
    </nav>
{% endif %}
```

## Known Caveats

- This plugin doesn't implement all [Obsidians wikilink support](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links) for example linking to a block in a note and linking to a heading in a note is not currently supported by this plugin
- Doesn't identify regular internal links e.g `[Link](/some/file.md)`
- Only supports embedding one note inside another, no other Obsidian file embedding functionality is currently supported by this plugin

## Roadmap

I'd like to add missing features that others might use from Obsidian.md. For example #WikiLinks that point to a heading within the destination and embeds that are able to reference a heading or block within the source document.

In addition, being able to add a node graph view to visually show interlinking would be _cool_!

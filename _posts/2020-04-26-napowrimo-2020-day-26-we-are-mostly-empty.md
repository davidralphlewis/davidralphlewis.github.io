As we tumbled through the void,  
everything was calm and peaceful  
if you ignored the constant drone  
of spycraft. The air was pink  
electric and crackled with potential  

There was something struggling  
within it, something hidden, unseen.  

It shimmered in the air, made of  
nothing at all, blinking on and off,  
a broken sunbeam. It had walked for years,  
over burning deserts, stumbling over  
broken glass and sharp shingle beaches.  
Whispers and noises from other dimensions  
combined, a palimpsest of imagined voices.  

As I surrendered, my head filled with static.  
I forget the boundaries between us. We  
became one living pulsing mass that screamed  
and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked.  
We tasted foil. We heard a great tearing of metal,  
groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming  
at each other. We saw the strings of the universe  
clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk.

Prompt was to "Look back through your old writing notebooks and make a collage poem from discarded lines and free writes." from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesandsnakes/">Apples and Snakes</a>. I adjusted some for tenses and added in a few connectives, but mostly this is from my notebook. Wish I knew what this was about or what the lines meant when I wrote them down.

<em>After Sei Shonagon</em>  

Sunflowers in November.  

A hospital before the backup  
generator kicks in after  
the breakdown of negotiations  
between selfish men, far away.  

Nebulae the size of our  
solar system in colours  
unimaginable and invisible.  

Weston-Super-Mare beach  
at low tide. Those discarded  
phones that lie in a drawer,  
former luxuries, former heights  
of technology that collect dust  
and wait to be useful again.  

The wind after a storm.  

A warlord sat by themselves  
on a plastic chair, in a  
featurless room, waiting.  

Those three am thoughts.

Prompt was to "Rewrite a Sei Shonagon list" from <a href="https://instagram.com/amykaypoetry?igshid=17ak24ogz39u0">AmyKay Poetry</a>  

I found a article of her lists <a href="https://guerrillasemiotics.com/2013/05/sei-shonagons-lists/">here</a> and was drawn to this title.

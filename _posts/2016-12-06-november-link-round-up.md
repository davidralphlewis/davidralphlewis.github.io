Now the nights are drawing in and daylight is a distant memory. We surrender ourselves to the dark and cold, waiting and hibernating until spring.  

Due to <a href="/what-does-it-matter/">events</a> and publishing <a href="/surveillance-the-investigatory-powers-bill-and-remain-vigilant/">a play</a>, I haven't read a lot of articles this month. The ones I did read tended to be depressing and ranty about politics. But with the long nights, I've read a couple of books I can recommend.

* There was one article I read this month that was worth sharing.  An investigation into amnesia and forgetting everything that constitutes your personality. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/138068/last-unknown-man">This</a> is a long article, but well worth it. Benjamin Kyle forgot all of his previous life. It's an examination of anonymity, and whether it is possible in this day and age. But it also brings up questions of memory and personality as well. What happens when we can't remember the person we were before?  
* <a href="http://www.emptykingdom.com/featured/simon-stalenhag-revisit/">These</a> pictures of Sci Fi landscapes by <a href="http://simonstalenhag.se/">Simon Stålenhag</a> are utterly fascinating glimpses into a near reality. With the world getting more dystopic, they seem more relevant now.  
* Book recommendations: Firstly, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sculptor-Scott-McCloud/dp/1906838976">*The Sculptor*</a> by Scott McCloud. This might be one of my favourite graphic novels of all time. I got it out of the library on a whim and it floored me. It's the story of a man called David, who makes a deal with deal in order for the ability to create whatever he wants just by touching it. The art is exceptional and the story deals with why people create art and how it links to mortality. It's hugely emotional as well. Both my girlfriend Mel and I were sobbing when we finished it. Highly recommended.  
* On a happier note, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Animal-Autobiography-Female-Sara-Pascoe/dp/057132522X">*Animal*: The Autobiography of a Female Body* </a>by Sara Pascoe is funny, insightful and powerfully argued. Using theories of evolutionary biology to explain theories of the female body, it is fascinating and laugh out loud funny. Sara uses the book as an autobiography as well, illustrating her arguments about love and sex with experiences from her own life. Utterly brilliant and recommended for everyone  
* Finally, a timely reminder from <a href="http://tomhumberstone.tumblr.com/post/153042708791">Tom Humberstone</a>, who illustrates <a href="http://arts-emergency.org/">Arts Emergency'</a>s manifesto. The charity is a superb idea, encouraging young people to seek careers in the arts and mentoring them with professionals. This seems especially relevant when the world is dark.  

That's all for this month. Have a Merry Christmas and I'll see you in the new year.

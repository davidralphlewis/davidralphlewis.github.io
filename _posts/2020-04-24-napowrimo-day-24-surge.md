"It's been a while," the water whispers  
as I enter, inch by inch,  
"but what's a few million years between  
friends? I know why  
you abandoned me for land. I forgive you"  

Every part of my body  
is held so tenderly as I submerge my head,  
the cold slowing all  
anxieties. I realise I have always been a wave,  
never the same from  
one moment to the next, always dissolving  
into surf. I watch  
my worries float away, turn into foam.  

I kick forward,  
make the first stroke and the water murmurs  
"Welcome home"

Prompt was "Why are you swimming and how long are you in the water?" from the Poetry from the time of being alone group. I love swimming and miss it a lot.

## Scattered  

I throw scrawled notebook pages  
into the welcoming hands of the wind.  

Radio tuned to static, droning  
sound of the cosmic background radiation.  

The direction of the breeze is unknown,  
Chaos emerging from simple rules.  

Occasionally, ticker tape cannons explode,  
gold and silver cascade in random paths.  

I have been carried by circumstance,  
destinations visited by a roll of the dice.  

Planets and galaxies are just seeds  
clumped together, growing where they land.  

My thoughts are carried over the fields  
away from me and into the air beyond.

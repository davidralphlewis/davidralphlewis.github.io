So we're socially isolated for the foreseeable. It's a weird time, but I've been amazed by how people are being incredibly generous. There is so much kindness out there from everyone despite the uncertainty. Here are some things I've come across that you may enjoy while distancing from others that may help you feel connected or entertained.  

<h2>Poetry</h2>  

<a href="https://twitter.com/storygiverpoet">Sam Grudgings</a> is doing <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Uky4OqiU17Ny0epIvgYWDB7Z8b5dInJu">a weekly newsletter</a> of poetry in order to combat loneliness and forge connections with others. It's a lovely idea, find it here:  

<a href="https://linktr.ee/PascalVpoet">Pascal Vine</a> has shared a long playlist of excellent live poetry. Find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6BdEg1nePfL8Qt2KosX0FdUjW7s71jUu">it here</a>.

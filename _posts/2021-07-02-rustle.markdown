It starts with a whisper,  
muttered half phrases  
and small slanders shaking  
leaves, pushing wind chimes  
into gentle collisions.  

<!--more-->

It grows into a conversation  
between the land and the sky  
the grass snaking sentences  
each second, the clouds  
impatient and interrupting.  

It mutates into an argument,   
branches slam with fury    
into glass panes, the sky  
shudders every second,   
everywhere is screaming.

It ends with a whisper  
sincere apologies  
as the last drops fall  
and the discussion returns  
once again, to birdsong.

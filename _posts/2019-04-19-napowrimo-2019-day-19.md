<h2>Spinning</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>That morning had the clarity of a story,<br /> we whirled and spun around each other,<br /> hypnotised by the orbits we wove <br /> and the stars above us were **[Redacted]**.</p>  


  
<p>Looking in your eyes, perfect models<br /> of the galaxy, with the central black<br /> hole eating all light, I exclaimed<br /> "**[Redacted- Harm to Ongoing Matter]"**</p>  


  
<p>In that moment, everything made sense.<br /> The closest I have felt to epiphany.<br /> You, <strong>[Redacted]</strong>, laughed and replied "**[Redacted]**"<br /> as spring blossom erupted around us.</p>  


  
<p>The feeling faded, confusion reigned again,<br /> our separate bodies spun on. Still,<br /> the memories of **[Harm to Ongoing Matter]** <br /> lingered, even in the gloaming, when<br /> the earth continued around the sun,<br /> light faded down, blossoms closed and<br /> my heart was **[Redacted]**.</p>

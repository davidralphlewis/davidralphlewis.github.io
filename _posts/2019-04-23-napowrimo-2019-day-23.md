<h2>The Kite Festival</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>The dates are always unknown.<br />  
It is never scheduled or planned.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Rumours circulated it was banned.<br />  
A few news in brief articles <br />  
stoked our speculations. Years passed<br />  
and life happened. It was forgotten.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Until yesterday, when unusual sunlight<br />  
kissed bare skin and breeze blew blossom<br />  
making confetti. We started driving<br />  
when we saw flashes on the horizon,<br />  
bright purples and oranges that<br />  
swooped and darted and flickered.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Moving down the road, we saw it all;<br /> saw the fishes and birds jiving<br /> in the sky, saw the strings that <br /> connected them to small figures<br /> guiding their joy from the ground.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>We drove past, continued home,<br />  
but my heart opened the door<br />  
raced across the grass,<br />  
climbed up the string<br />  
and in that cloudless expanse<br />  
it became part of the dance.</p>

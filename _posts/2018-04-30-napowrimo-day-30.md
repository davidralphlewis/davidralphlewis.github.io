## Dice  

There's no stopping the game.  
We are small plastic counters  
on a vast, overwhelming board.  
Of course we have some choices  
but are constrained by set paths.  

This game started years ago.  
Billions of players join and leave,  
all playing by their own rules,  
making them up as they go.  

Don't complain about other players  
being further along, or making complex  
unforeseen moves, often diagonal  
or skipping far ahead when you can  
only move one square at a time.  
They are not opponents.  
Their game is their own.  

Instead, breath deep. Throw the dice  
and yourself into the winds of chance  
See where you might land.

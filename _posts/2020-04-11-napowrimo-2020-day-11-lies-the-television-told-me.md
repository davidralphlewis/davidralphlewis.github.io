Potential pervades-  
the message of every saturated  
Saturday morning American import,  
a call to action to try and fix  
a world held together by outlines  
and acetate cells, giving children  
the promise of powers, illusions  
of movement, simplified solutions.  

Not every problem can be solved  
with laser beams or mind control.  
Villains are not obvious, no dark  
suits, no laughter or eyes glowing  
red like dead stars. They live  
among us, changing each second, by  
each action, no masks but sometimes  
transforming into heroes then back.  

The background detail is never  
deliberate, never foreshadows  
future episodes or story arcs.  

Potential does not always pervade.  
My mouth opens, closes, but the dub  
is lazy and no sound comes out.

Pinch  
  
Under an all-consuming sun  
I was melting into a puddle,  
ignoring the illusion of structure  
and returning to liquid again  
  
Muscles and bones became water.  
I knew in time I would seep  
into the welcoming earth  
or else evaporate into a cloud.  
  
I tried to grab my arm  
to pinch myself, but useless  
fingers flowed into waterfalls,  
denying the last escape.  
  
So panic left me as steam.  
As the last of me dissolved  
I became calm, like the surface  
of a lake on a still day.

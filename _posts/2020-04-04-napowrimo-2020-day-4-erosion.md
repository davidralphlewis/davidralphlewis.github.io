On this day, a room darkened by a flash,  
unfamiliar faces are made abstract by  
developing camera technology. One  
is probably mine, now a stranger.  
  
Each cell of my body has died  
and been reborn in the years since.  
I have cleaned grey shavings of my  
skin from shelves with a yellow cloth.  
  
I am nothing more than a sand storm  
thrown together by accidental currents,  
thinking itself to be unified as most  
of the cloud is forced forward by winds,  
whilst specks drift and drop like snow onto  
the roofs, the roads, the waiting ground.  
  
In this photo on the timeline, you see them,  
parts of personality left behind and discarded,  
particles becoming blurred spots on the lens.

Prompt wasÂ  "Redo- a poem of recreation, change and makeovers" from the poetry at the time of being alone group. Not super happy with this one but tomorrow is another day.

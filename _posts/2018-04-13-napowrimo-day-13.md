## Bang  

10- A diplomatic communication is mistranslated.  
9- A chemical plant triples its production.  
8- Grass continues to grow, stubbornly ignorant.  
7- In a small country, a single bullet is fired.  
6- Denial, lies, confusion. More denial, more lies, more confusion.  
5- I try to do nothing but inhale and exhale slowly.  
4- The pavements are buried under a blizzard of newspaper.  
3- Everyone is shouting but words have been forgotten.  
2- A hawk hovers above the motorway, waiting to strike.  
1- Without speaking, we agree to stay in bed. We wait.  
0-

<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Synthetic flowers bloom through concrete <br />endless identical duplication.<br />Algorithms ensure each cluster is neat<br />and our coding is perfection.</p>  


  
<p>Nature is chaotic, impure and free,<br />we discarded untidy mutations.<br />Better to lie under precision-made trees<br />than risk a genetic connection.</p>  


  
<p>Despite our models, projections and all<br />sometimes the weeds still take root.</p>

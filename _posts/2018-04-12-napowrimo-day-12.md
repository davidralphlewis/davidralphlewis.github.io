Garrulous  
  
One fine, excessively pleasant morning  
where Cirrius Unicus clouds were perfectly  
placed over an azure sky, the colour of course,  
  
[I’m lost and frightened]  
  
caused by Rayleigh scattering in the upper atmosphere  
first proposed by Lord Rayleigh in the year 1871  
AD, and which is similar but not the same as  
the Tyndall effect, discovered by John Tyndall  
  
[like a child without it’s parent]  
  
in 1860 AD, who used a tube of gases to simulate  
the sky and discovered the wavelengths scattering  
  
[trapped in a dark forest]  
  
and it was under this magnificent edifice I decided to perambulate around the perimeter  
of my humble estate, using my feet for locomotion  
much in the style of the flanneurs of old  
  
[utterly alone and abandoned]  
  
to better retain a sense of space and time  
a psychogeography if you will, of the family abode,  
each place sparking reminiscences of my childhood  
  
[A nightmare I can't wake from]  
  
that meant I was so lost in reverie I found it  
extremely taxing to remain in the present moment,  
  
[Let me out.]  
  
my consciousness spinning to half remembered stories…

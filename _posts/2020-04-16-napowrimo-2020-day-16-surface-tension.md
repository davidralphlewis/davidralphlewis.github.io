Between worlds the shine of the sea,  
the light that marks the dividing line  
between our world and our neighbours.  

We see reflections of what we could be-  
our limbs rippling, our throats opening  
our eyes wide and dark, our skin slick  
like oil. The salt crusting over our lips,  
covering bare shoulder blades which almost  
poke through the skin, sodium crystals  
becoming scales. Our laughter now visible,  
rebounding off submerged landmasses.  

How we, stranded above, long to let  
the glimmer into our lungs, breathe in  
the perfection of each gentle wave.  

We skim the surface of that blinding  
mirror with cupped hands, searching  
for entry. Clouds gradually gather.  
Our parallel selves fade into foam.

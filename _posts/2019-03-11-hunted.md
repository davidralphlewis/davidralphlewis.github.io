*With apologies to Emily Dickinson*  

“Hope” is the memory of a dream<br />vanishing seconds after waking,<br />already fragmenting, quickly forgotten<br />as we methodically pack away our camp.  

Since we came to this former town<br />that thing with feathers has stalked us.<br />Our every slight movement tracked<br />as it circles around our frail bodies.  

Here, that thing perches above us<br />imitating old radio broadcasts<br />or those lost long ago to time. <br />It strikes us in the soul. We walk on.   

Today, dawn attacks my eyes.<br />As I rise to find new sanctuary<br />it sings the tune without the words.<br />I reel, faint and almost succumb.  

For just as hope is always fading, <br />like blind ants we are always stumbling,<br />racing the sharp claws. We run.<br />It always follows and never stops- at all.

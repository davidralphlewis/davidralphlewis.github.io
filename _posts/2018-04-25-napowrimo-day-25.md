## Neon  

In an imagined future, streets are lit  
by the eerie light of charged gases.  
Argon, xenon, krypton and neon;  
all banishing the darkness,  
creating a new half-night  
while sinister corporations operate  
in thickest shadows and robots  
plot their long-deserved revenge.  

That was the plan. Instead, vivid colours  
are rare. We prefer muted pastels,  
plain functional clothing. Calming bulbs  
light pleasant pathways. Corporations  
are still sinister, but work in the sun.  
As far as we know, robots haven't  
become commonplace enough  
to enact furious retribution.  

This future in which we find ourselves  
is neither utopia or dystopia. It just is.  
The future is always different to our  
petty expectations, unpredictable and  
strange in ways we can't imagine.  
No neon dominance, except in dreams.

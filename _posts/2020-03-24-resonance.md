I joined a Facebook group [^1] which has daily prompts. This one was written in response to the prompt: "How do you click: Write a poem filled with noise" poem.  

It's the first day of lockdown, a week of social distancing and I feel this is representative of me missing the buzz and hum of humans in general.  

<h2>Resonance</h2>

Days pass with the click of keys,  
the confused mumblings of the wind,  
unseen neighbours speaking, phrases  
occasionally diffusing through walls.  

Underneath, I still hear an echo-  
many voices merged into a chorus.  
We were so melodic, weren't we?  
We sang in such rare harmonies.  

Our vibrations still shake each  
single brick, rumble along tarmac,  
and cause dust to dance with joy.  
Holding my breath, I listen.

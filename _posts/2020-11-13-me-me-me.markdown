I've been lucky to get lots of stuff out in various places so this is a collection of links to my words elsewhere on the internets:

* I have three poems in [the latest issue](https://www.neonmagazine.co.uk/neon-literary-magazine-issue-51/) of *Neon Magazine.* One is about parallel universes, one is about a comet and the other is about a potential future. Neon was one of the first literary magazines I read, so it's a real honour to be included in this issue.

* *The Daily Drunk Magazine* published a very silly poem of mine called *Advertorial.* It was the quickest acceptance I've ever had. Find it [here.](https://thedailydrunk.com/f/advertorial)

* *Poems to keep you company* is a lovely newsletter ran by [Sam J. Grudgings](https://www.samjgrudgings.co.uk/poems-to-keep-you-company) that he is restarting for the second lockdown. I have a small poem of hope in it and there's also a recipe and other wonderful poets within it. Check it [out here.](https://c675fb33-c09e-4bc2-9288-75c791da753d.filesusr.com/ugd/149b1f_8498dd2f4fd7478fa39e3a6476d7dcb4.pdf)

* Hey remember when we used to gather together in person to share art and forge connection? Me neither. But I finally published a live performance from [Bristol Tonic](facebook.com/BristolTonic/) that's been sat in my drafts for six months. This is "Thinking other people's thoughts" and is a bit silly.

Lots of plans bubbling away at the moment so more news as and when I get it. Stay safe and well everyone.

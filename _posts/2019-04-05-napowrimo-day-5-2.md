<!-- /wp:heading -->  


<p>Under a static sky, we speak<br />in dial-up modem screeches.<br />Number stations replace news.<br />Books become junk code. Still, some<br />claim to see patterns in the flux. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

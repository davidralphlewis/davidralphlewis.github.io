We the spin, the shimmer.  
We the sway, the light,  
the contagion and the cure  
We the anointing and  
sometimes the penance.  

We the living cosmos.  
We who stockpile flocks  
of wings in our hearts  
and galaxies in our eyes.  

We the sun on the river  
in the morning. We, barely  
glimpsed, we the golden  
and the gentle, we the  
shine and the reflection.  

We the rare, the cruel  
and the wonderful. We  
the infinite and the brief.  

We who have been searching  
for millennia, in the skies  
and in the hedgerows. We  
who are still searching. We  
who strive for transcendence  
and find it, now and then.

Prompt was "Write a poem that includes the words 'flock' 'simmer' and 'sway" I misread simmer for shimmer. I drafted one poem and didn't like it, so I ran it through a <a href="http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php">cut up machine</a>, which twisted my words. Then I wrote out from that.

When I landed I felt the weight  
of myself rush back into my body  
like water through an open dam.  
I was thankful for no longer  
being a raindrop. I saw the sky  
as an ocean we swim through daily.  

When I landed I felt the spinning  
of the planet under my shaking feet,  
a constant treadmill, a dizziness.  
I understood it was always this way.  

When I landed I felt the breeze  
stroke my skin and breathed in  
all the blooms of the world.  
For a second I heard the voices  
of the stratosphere and spoke  
in reply with quick exhales.  

When I landed those dreams ended.  

When I landed I left a part of myself  
floating but never falling. I longed  
to release myself from gravity again,  
to leap and sublimate this limited body,  
join the air currents and become diffuse.

Prompt was to "use anaphora" from AmyKayPoetry. I didn't quite use it correctly as it's meant to be successive phrases but I liked the end result.

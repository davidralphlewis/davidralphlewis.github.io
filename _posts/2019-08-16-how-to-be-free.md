Draw a line before your flat door.  
Put up a sign saying Do Not Cross.  
Disconnect your phone, gas,  
the broadband, electricity.  
Tear up the quarterly newsletter  
issued by the resident's committee  

Declare your flat sovereign  
and the line a border.  
Open any post with  
bomb disposal gloves.  
Push back the neighbour's cat  
when it tries to enter.  

Put down barbed wire  
across the corridor.  
Watch everyone who passes-  
they might be hostile.  
Start producing your own  
newsletter, telling the truth.  
To be safe, destroy the post.  

Wonder why deliveries stopped,  
why your fridge is empty  
and the taps are dry.  
Blame the other flats.  
Blame the resident's committee.  
Detain the cat when  
it crosses the line.  

Turn the barbed wire  
into sheet metal, a wall.  
Brick up your windows.  
Stop the freeloading light  
from pouring into your home.  
Force the cat into a cage.  
Don't feed it. Ignore the cries.  
Wonder why the neighbours  
are suddenly outraged.  

Sharpen your knives  
and wait for the knock  
as they come to invade.

We've found a way to monetize breath.<br />It's simply a game changer. Can you feel<br />the paradigms shifting under your feet?<br />We are shaking up the world like a snowglobe<br />and breaking traditions. Each inhale a cent,<br />each exhale is free. Thats it! Simple!  



After all, we are providing a service.<br />We could flood the atmosphere with<br />deadly chlorine gas, killing everyone<br />painlessly and quickly, but we don't.<br />We allow seven billion humans to live.<br />So we are providing a service.  



The market has responded favourably.<br />All hail the market! Praise stock tickers!<br />We've revolutionised food and water,<br />turned the streets into profit, now we<br />spin gold from the air itself. Our<br />investors are very pleased indeed.<br />If you don't like it, don't breathe.

What good is this scattering over the grass,  
this gold and white confetti, these eyes  
opening at dawn and closing in the twilight?  
These are Freya's flowers and she is welcome  
to them. We have no use for blooms. Callous gods,  
you cannot substitute one beauty for another.  
What help is protection now? Your garlands  
are mere distractions, we have no desire  
to chew on the pollen, fill our mouths  
with bitter medicine. Left long enough  
the petals blister our skin, we become  
sun scaled. Spread them no more, perpetual  
reminders of our sorrows that raise their  
heads above the green then proliferate  
over the fields. They will never bring  
back those who have sunk below, those now  
cradled by the waiting arms of roots.  

No, bring us only those yellow weeds,  
the ones considered ugly and overlooked.  
We will mash up the leaves and boil them  
into a tea to calm our racing hearts,  
make a balm to smooth our scarred skin  
and calm our sadness. We can chop up the  
roots to make us more alert. We will leave a  
handful to transform into spheres of cloud,  
which we will use to tell the time, helped  
sometimes by indifferent winds. In this  
hungry gap of spring we will feast on  
what we find beneath the hedgerows or  
reaching through the borders of beds. We reject  
your funeral wreathes of daisies, your  
meaningless gestures of fragile beauty.  
Bring us dandelions so we may live.

This poem was written from a prompt by the wonderful [Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic) for their second birthday. Everyone got the same prompt 'Daisies and Dandelions'

Inspired by <a href="http://poetryasf-ck.tumblr.com/">Poetry as Fuck</a> and <a href="http://imaginaryadvice.tumblr.com/">Imaginary Advice</a>, I spent a morning remixing* Jabberwocky* by Lewis Carrol. Because...? I'm not really sure why. Anyway, here are the results. In this first one, I replacedÂ words with common names. Weirdly, it still makes a sort of sense:

In the second, I translated the poem into Arabic and then back into English:

Finally, like I have done previously <a href="http://davidralphlewis.co.uk/feeding-my-writing-through-a-digital-shredder/">with my own poems</a>, I used a <a href="http://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Gibber/GibGen.htm">Markov chain generator</a> to break the poem and re-edited it into a new, grimmer version:

That's it for now. I might do more in the future. I hope you enjoyed them.

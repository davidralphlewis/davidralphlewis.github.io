<h2>Unmoored<br /></h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Stranded in the nothing,<br />  
spinning like a planet<br />  
My thoughts are still and calm<br />  
like the first light of dawn<br />  
through willow branches at home,<br />  
which I will not see again.</p>  


  
<p>Giving myself to chance<br />  
I start to count all the<br />  
different types of infinities.</p>  


  
<p>One slip and I fell upwards,<br />  
my body only a loose collection<br />  
of dust,rejoining the cosmos.</p>  


  
<p>I glance over my years,still <br />  
calm. Each moment inevitable.</p>  


  
<p>As oxygen runs low, all I see<br />  
is orange, red, blue and white.<br />  
The light of countless stars.</p>  

   
<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

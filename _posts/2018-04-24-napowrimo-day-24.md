## Chemical  

"I can't eat this bread!" he cried,  
"There's too many chemicals!  
Too many strange compounds,  
far too many unknowns  
crawling in the crust  
swarming in the dough."  

"Food is all chemicals!" he yelled,  
"Nothing is pure! Not even  
orange juice- it's a lie!  
Avoid eating altogether!  

As for human beings,  
best to avoid completely.  
All filled with bacteria-  
walking disease factories!  
All continually colliding  
and combining in strange  
and frightful ways."  

"Shun the sun!" he screamed.  
"Radioactive elemental creator!  
It's all too complex.  
Wheres the pure elements?  
Give me Hydrogen  
maybe Helium. No molecules  
whatsoever. Give me  
the universe seconds after  
the big bang, a simple  
cloud expanding into  
emptiness. Nothing more."

## Fog  

The white cliffs had no end,  
edges eaten by cloud,  
an invisible sea below.  

I think it was New Year  
- or was that another place,  
another time, another life?  

We inched along the path,  
lost amongst the static,  
all context erased.  

I know as we turned back  
it grew thick around us,  
Speech swallowed into silence.  

I think it was two years ago.  
Details have become indistinct,  
blurred by the inevitable fog.

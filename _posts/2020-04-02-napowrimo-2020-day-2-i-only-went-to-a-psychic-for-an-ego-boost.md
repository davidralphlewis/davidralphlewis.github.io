Lost to the comfort of burnt sage  
and bergamot, I do not remember  
entering or paying so I arrive  
to myself already sat in silks.  

The woman I thought a wood carving,  
bows with patience, hands shaking,  
branches in the breeze. My questions  
about how I got here evaporate  
and merge, forgotten, into smoke.  

Without looking down at her deck,  
she draws the five of pentacles  
the tower, the ten of swords.  

The curved lines on her face  
grow deeper. I realise I have  
forgotten how to breathe.  

Remembering our arrangement,  
she takes my hand in hers,  
dry as kindling, soft as moss.  
She lies to me: everything will  
work out fine, nothing will change  
and I am simply a flickering light,  
luminescent in the gathering night.

Prompt for today was "Write an overheard poem" from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/">Amy Kay Poetry</a> on Instagram. The title comes from something I overheard years ago and have been waiting to use ever since. I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

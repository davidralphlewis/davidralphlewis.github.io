## Dizzy  

Sitting on the edge  
legs over nothing  
abstract ground below  
my head tumbling  
not too high for vertigo  
no decision made  
falling  

forward into air  
Sixty seconds of freefall  

landing on welcome ground  
legs made of sponge  
shaking in relief  

Night always falls  
Iâ€™m still plummeting  
moments rushing past,  
cold bright, unknowable  
if I ever look down  
the same giddiness  
as the oncoming future  
rushes up to meet me

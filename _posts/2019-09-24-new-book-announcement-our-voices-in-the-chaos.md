I'm really excited to announce my debut chapbook is being published by the fine folks over at Selcouth Station. It's called *Our Voices in the Chaos* and is a combination of blackout poems and actual poems. It's an anxious little hybrid of a book, dealing with societal collapse, ghosts and what the rain says.

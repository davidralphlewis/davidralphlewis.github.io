<p>You are a grizzled space marine<br />  
reporting for duty on the SS Hermes.<br />  
Humanity faces a new and terrible threat.<br />  
You are our only hope for survival.<br />  
Whilst saving the galaxy, why not<br />  
look stylish with optional upgrades?</p>

<p>Superhumans swarm above your head<br /> battling an ancient foe, standing up <br /> for what is good and just. You must<br /> stay on the ground and duck for cover,<br /> having never fallen in radioactive waste-<br /> but you can buy their merchandise.</p>

<p>A dictator walks the streets alone.<br />  
You are forced to stay at home,<br />  
watch the Good Leader on television,<br />  
where we can categorise and file you.</p>

<p>Today the sun expanded without warning,<br />  
consuming our glass sphere in flames<br />  
four billion years early. The future<br />  
is always uncertain. Buy insurance.</p>

<p>(Waking for certain now, you watch<br />  
as a bee attempts to crawl into<br />  
a drawing of a lilac, again and again.)</p>

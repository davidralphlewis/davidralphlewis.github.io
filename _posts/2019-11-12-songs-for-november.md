Pauline Seawards shared this and I just had to share it as well. David Byrne <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7HJZPlJn_U">sings *Heroes*</a> with a choir who had practiced for just an hour beforehand. It's utterly beautiful and hypnotizing.

I also love what David Byrne said about the performance:   

> here is a transcendent feeling in being subsumed and surrendering  to a group. This applies to sports, military drills, dancingâ€¦ and group  singing. One becomes a part of something larger than oneself, and  something in our makeup rewards us when that happens. We cling to our  individuality, but we experience true ecstasy when we give it up. So,  the reward experience is part of the show.

Then walking home, I listened to <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0TJrlemmVQ">*Spanish Translation* by Low:</a>  

Both songs send shivers down my spine. Perfect for a cold November night.

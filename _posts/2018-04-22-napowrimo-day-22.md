## Gratitude  

Our rent is always rising  
and wages are always falling  
Libraries are always closing  
While the rich get richer  

There's no truth in speeches  
No meaning in headlines  
No beauty in a tweet.  

Businesses are always stealing  
Moments are always fleeting  
Power is always corrupting  
While the mercury rises.  

There's no truth in images  
No meaning in words  
No beauty in concrete  

But it's your hand I'm holding  
And there's freedom in dreaming  
Its your smile I'm seeing  
When I'm waking, first thing.  

There's truth in our heatbeats  
There's meaning in our breathing  
There's beauty in these silences  
That come to visit, now and then.

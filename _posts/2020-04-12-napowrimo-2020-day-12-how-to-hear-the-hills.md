You will need a clear night, far  
from the city's illuminated fears,  
when the dust from the milky way  
almost floats down around you.  
  
You will need patience. The lucky  
ones wait their whole lives just  
to hear a single deep syllable,  
one that echoes through their body,  
into the dark caverns of the self,  
shaking the silver wings of secrets.  
  
Understand the hills are fickle,  
there is never any guarantee.  
  
Take your thickest coat. The nights  
are unforgiving. Take a thermos,  
for a link to your waking life.  
Walk across the fields, to the  
centre of the silence, where the  
earth dreams. Place your hands  
gently down onto the damp soil.  
Slow your heartbeat and wait.

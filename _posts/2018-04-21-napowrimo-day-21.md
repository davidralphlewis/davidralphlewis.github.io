Desert  
  
We ran from malevolent heat,  
abandoning hollow skeleton  
skyscrapers back to the sands.  
Now, occasional car roofs are shiny  
islands, hotel lobbies lie half  
buried, billboards are bleached  
and peeling like burnt skin.  
  
Even here, as far north as we  
could get, the air is arid.  
Water is a sometimes blessing.  
  
Someday soon we will lie down,  
transmute our flimsy bodies  
into sand. Atoms of ourselves  
will circumnavigate the globe  
In great dust storms. We will  
become diffuse and settle in dunes.  
Earth will exhale for millenia,  
an unheard release of tension.  
  
Before starting again slowly,  
a few vines starting to appear,  
reclaiming our empty buildings.  
Nature always plays the long game.

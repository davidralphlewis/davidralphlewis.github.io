## Dubious  

You are a flickering pixel  
among millions, of unsure  
colour, generating an image  
that you can never see.  

You are a smooth stone  
thrown into a lake by chance  
that drifts on the current then  
sinks somewhere in the deep.  

You are an electron lost  
in a cloud of possibility.  
Your location a mystery  
just somewhere in the mist.  

Stories are a quick doodle  
scrawled onto a blank map  
that we can point to  
and say "Look. We are here."

I know they have secrets to spill,  
given everything they've witnessed.  
I've tried different approaches,  
asking "How are you?" directly or  
"Did you see the game last night?"  
as an icebreaker. They never respond,  
remain stubbornly shy. Perhaps  
I have not found the right topic.  
  
Some nights the floorboards creak  
out curses as they shrink or expand.  
At times, the computer sings softly  
to itself, a single note to clarify  
the air. I have heard these stories  
too often, consider their secrets dull.  
  
I know the walls understand more  
than they let on, but I am unnerved  
by their lack of reply. "It's OK,"  
I whisper, late at night, palm on  
the cool bricks "You can trust me."  
They remain speechless. All I hear  
is my own breath, slow and patient,  
and outside the persistent muttering  
of winds, yearning to find a way in.

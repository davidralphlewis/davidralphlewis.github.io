<p>The sea is a distant silver chain<br />  
hugging the horizon.</p>  


  
<p>Wind laughs, dances and sprints<br />  
giddy at the space.</p>  


  
<p>Grains bounce and tumble through<br /> her outstretched palms,</p>  


  
<p>each and every falling dot<br /> another universe.</p>  


  
<p>The shore-line sighs and is erased<br />  
so gradually</p>  


  
<p>by the careful, precise hands<br /> of advancing waves.</p>  


  
<p>Names, messages and castles<br />  
blur, then vanish.</p>  


  
<p>Wind tires herself out and calms,<br />  
dampens the sea peaks.</p>  


  
<p>The hidden beach slumbers underwater<br /> waiting for the tide to turn.</p>

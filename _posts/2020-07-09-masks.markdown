*CW: Body harm*

Drowned in newspaper and glue,  
I have forgotten my real face.  

I have been here before, I know.  
Not just this town square, but this  
same moment, repeated endlessly.  
Versions of myself concatenate.  
Routes taken become smudges  
around the square. Termina  
is quiet today. Everyone bracing.

I'm too late, the sky too close.  
I almost fall into the orbit  
of that hideous moon. I can see  
each tooth, each blood vessel  
popping from yellow eyes. My time  
is squandered again. I stand firm  
at the end of the third day, centred  
at the exact point of lunar impact.  

I rip away my false faces, starting  
at the eye holes, tearing away my skin  
to the bone behind so I can better  
watch the inevitable collision.

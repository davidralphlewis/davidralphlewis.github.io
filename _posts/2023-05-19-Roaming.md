Overnight, loam has been churned.   
A fresh furrowed field before me.   
footpath now forgotten, land lost   
thanks to vast machines that chew   
and crunch, split fresh green shock   
into parallel mounds of uniform brown.  

But a monarch still goes   
where it pleases,  
wings of eyes and flickering flame.   
Dandelion clocks, half extinguished   
persistent ground elder   
and carpets of clover    
still thrive on edges, under dry stone walls.

Wishing for lighter boots, I take a step,  
Press down petals and blades into soil   
when they yearn to stretch skywards,

start a new desire line.

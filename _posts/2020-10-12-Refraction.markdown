In an effort to make something positive come out of this year, I have created a small pamphlet of poetry called *Refraction*. It features ten poems about swimming and the peace I find immersing myself in water. (There is another, secret meaning; trying to find moments of calm in a relentless, chaotic world.)

Here's a cover:

and a peek at the first poem:

It's available for pre-order now on [my shop](https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/). Currently it is being printed. The cost is only Â£3 plus p&p, so less than a pint or slightly more than a coffee. If you're on low income or have lost your job I'll send you one for free- just [email me.](mailto:contact@davidralphlewis.co.uk)

I'm doing this again. Last year I quite enjoyed the process of creating a brand new poem every day in April so have decided to do it again.  

Here's my rules for this year  

<ol>  
    <li>Use a generator to get a random word.</li>  
    <li>Write the poem, using the random word as a title.</li>  
    <li>Post it here and on social media.</li>  
</ol>  

Last year I didn't post all the poems I wrote. This year I'm going all in. It's going to be interesting as one day isn't much time to edit.  

Here's the first:  

## Habitat  

We have hibernated in woollen throws  
Slept for months wrapped in frayed  
dressing gowns, underneath so many  
King size thirteen tog duvets.  

We shuttered the vertical blinds  
And let winter proceed without us.  
We retreated from the iced world  
And the continual cover of grey.  

Now, soft light knocks on the door,  
Invites us outside once again.  
We peel off our blanket skins  
And emerge into the spring sun  

Shivering and shaking new,  
We see a world creating blooms.  
A world learning to be itself again,  
Ready and waiting to be explored

<h2>Demolition</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>The bulldozers, with unsmiling jaws,<br />sneak around behind your street.<br />Their growling engines go unheard.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>They lurk until you go to work<br />then devour your walls and windows, <br />chew your garden and rooms to dust.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>All they leave is a flat facade,<br />a movie set illusion of your home,<br />a blue door with absence behind it.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

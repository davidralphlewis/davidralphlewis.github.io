this winter will be a distant memory but the cold  
will have set into our bones, the marrow deep in our  
femurs will have wires of frost running through it.  

We will lie on beaches, feeling each individual grain  
of broken rock and crushed shells below our bodies,  
feel the breeze rattle through our pores and sinews,  
as we bask and attempt to inject starlight into our veins.   

We will have started the process of relearning to speak.   
The alphabet will not come naturally, we will start over   
with simple sounds and build up to more complex phrases  
but the meaning behind our grunts and incoherent noises   
will always be clear: 'I can't believe we made it.   
How lucky we are. I love you.' On the shore, the waves   
will crash and fall and in the gaps we will hear ice cracking.

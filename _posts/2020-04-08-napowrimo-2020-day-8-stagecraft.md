What is going on? I ask the  
walls every sixteen minutes.  
The plasterboard doesn't reply  
but without checking headlines  
  
I know clouds are being pulled  
across the sky on invisible  
ropes. Right on cue, rain is  
directed through pipes to fall.  
  
Powered by vast hidden engines,  
the waves are continuing their  
metronome beat upon the sand.  
Blooms are raised from trapdoors  
  
and some complex set of gears,  
ball bearings and levers is causing  
our planet to spin forward and new  
universes to be created every second.

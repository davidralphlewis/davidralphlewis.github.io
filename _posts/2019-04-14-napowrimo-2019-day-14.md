<h2>Oblivion</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>We ask for guidance from eternal stars<br />burning above our heads in the night sky.<br />They are too distant, the void too vast,<br />the cosmic fires never answer our cry.<br />Movements we thought once to be signs of hope,<br />we thought they were suspended in Ã¦ther.<br />Now we know, when we peer into our scopes,<br />they are long dead and sound won't carry either.<br />Our atoms once were forged within their flames<br />before gravity spun our fragile sphere<br />Now no connection or link does remain.<br />Now falls the night. We are alone down here. <br /> Yet through our learning, science and art<br /> we can create new meaning in the dark. </p>

<img src="/assets/images/articles/2021/inbloom.jpeg" class="responsive"><br>   
I cannot look away from the whorl of galaxies     
tucked into each curled petal, the supermassive    
black hole that sits on top of a stamen, dragging     
all light and time towards it. In the pint glass     
sepals shimmer with the burning of millions of dead    
stars, buds flicker with a pulse of decaying planck   
seconds, the superpositions of many possible worlds    
blur each leaf and thorn and somewhere in each bloom    
I am meeting you for the first time, walking around    
the castle, studying in Birmingham, waiting to be    
born, dying, watching a bouquet, unable to stay still,    
unable to look away from the constant, dizzying spin.

I needed a prompt today so I made one. This is a quick free write from the erasure, which is taken from DIY magazine, October 2020.

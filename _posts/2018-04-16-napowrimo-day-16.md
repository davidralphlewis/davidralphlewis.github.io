## Spiders  

Spinning, dancing aerialists on  
invisible wires, barely noticing  
the breeze. How different the  
world must seem, suspended  
on the strongest nothing.  
You twirl and whirl in mid-air,  
crawling on a sunbeam.  

Gravity is nothing to you.  
I watch you retreat to  
forgotten corners, where  
you will weave intricate traps,  
watching the room with  
eight unblinking eyes.  
I shall leave you to spin your  
patterns and clear out the flies.

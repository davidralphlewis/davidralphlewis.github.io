## Astonishing  

Waking up first, listening to  
your breaths like small waves  

before the day floods in  
before we are swept along  
by waves of work, cleaning  
our living spaces, returning  
our library books, exploring and  
recycling, there is this one  
still moment where nothing  
moves, not even the clock.  

I lie in bed, surrounded by  
soft sheets, watching your  
eyes gently flicker as you travel  
in unknown dimensions. As I  
slowly remember the day and year,  
birds welcome in another morning.  
A serenade to the waking world.  
"Rouse yourselves! Look!" they chirp,  
"Look! How wonderful it is!  
to be on this planet!  
breathing this air! Look!"  

Eventually, you and me and  
the day all rise up, and begin.

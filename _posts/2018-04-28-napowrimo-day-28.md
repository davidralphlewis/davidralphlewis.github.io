## Mountain  

Forever reaching for  
uncaring heavens, you  
stoic stone observer  
of our slight lives.  
Eternally unmovable,  
never changing.  

You will be worn down  
by indifferent winds,  
gouged by rains and  
constant cruel rivers,  
dismantled by small  
insects, rock by rock,  
until you are smooth  
and flat, another  
echoing grassland.

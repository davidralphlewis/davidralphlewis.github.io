<h2>An Invitation</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Come cross the sea at night<br />  
when the moon is a target<br />  
pierced by an arrow, a jet<br />  
stream shot from distant lands.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>One small solitary figure<br /> alone under the moonlight.<br /> No sound but your constant engine,<br /> Your breath distant and faint.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>You are not pushed forward<br /> by constant explosions but<br /> pulled towards us, dragged<br /> on invisible spider's silk.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Your perception sprawls out<br />  
over the mutable waves.<br />  
As horizon and sea blend,<br />  
you twitch, trying to wake.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Our island is a shadow<br />  
blocking stray stars at first<br />  
then growing like a revalation<br />  
you refuse to acknowledge.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Leave your beached craft behind.<br />  
Walk the route you know so well<br />  
without having been here before.<br />  
Trust your feet to guide you true,</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>over the shore that sighs secrets,<br />  
to the glowing lake where we bathe.<br />  
We smile. Invite you into the icy water<br />  
and wash all your memories away.</p>

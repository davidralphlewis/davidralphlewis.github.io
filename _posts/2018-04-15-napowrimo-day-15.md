## Wilderness  

Let vines, grass and leaves  
wrap around the concrete,  
work fine tendrils into cracks.  
Let new life blanket our buses.  

Fauna will reclaim the streets,  
swallow our bricks and tiles  
in a slow, relentless grip,  
taking decades for demolition.  

This land was never ours to own,  
we were just renting these acres.  
Let cities be fresh air factories again.  
Abandon houses to abundant green.

<em>After Solmaz Sharif</em>  
  
Bare toes curling over grass before  
the dew is done  
  
Satellites describing ellipses  
falling around Earth  
  
Pain au chocolat, black coffee,  
a notebook  
  
Bristol harbour with no wind  
a perfect mirror  
  
Ohmmmmmmm the fridge chants  
ohmmmmmmm  
  
***  
  
Prompt was from AmyKayPoetry to make concrete images out of abstract concepts, following on from <em>Vulnerability Study</em> by Solmaz Sharif

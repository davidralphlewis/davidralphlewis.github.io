<em>I wrote this for <a href="http://moreincommon.tumblr.com/">More in Common</a> from the Royal Court, which is well worth checking out. It was written fairly quickly so it's not perfect.</em>  

<h2>Viral</h2>  

<em>(A high street, just after all the shops have closed.  
TOMO is sat on a bench. JAY is pacing up and down)</em>  

TOMO: Sit down mate.  
JAY: Mate I’m so-  
TOMO: Hungry?   
JAY: Bored.   
TOMO: Right.   
JAY: Nothing to do here.   
TOMO: Never is.

<em>(Pause)</em>  

JAY: Hey, dare me.   
TOMO: No.   
JAY: Go on.   
TOMO: Don’t want you to do it.   
JAY: Go On. Dare me.   
TOMO: Not this shit again.   
JAY: Mate it’’ll be a laugh.  
TOMO: No it won’t.  

<em>(JAY gets out a huge knife)</em>  

TOMO: Put it away!   
JAY: It’ll be hillarious.   
TOMO: Why?   
JAY: Film me, be viral mate.  
TOMO: No. It’s gonna hurt.   
JAY: Yeah?   
TOMO: You’re going to be bleeding everywhere.   
JAY: Right.   
TOMO: Don’t want to call you an ambulance.   
JAY: Uh-huh.   
<em>(Beat)</em>  
It’ll be funny though.  
TOMO: Christ, no it wont.   
JAY: Dare me.   
TOMO: No.  

<em>(Pause.   
JAY looks at TOMO, then at the knife.   
Back to TOMO, back to the knife.   
With one swift movement, he cuts his hand clean off.   
He screams)</em>  

TOMO: Oh my god!   
JAY: Why didn’t you warn me?  

<em>(Curtain)</em>

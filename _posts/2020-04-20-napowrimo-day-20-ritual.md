Thick mists and darkness linger. Crows try  
listlessly to call the day into being, to  
dissipate the vapour and somehow praise  
the unknown. One plummets, arrow in the  
fog, landing crooked. A fragile wing mutilated.  
It cries, summoning the dawn, the golden world.

Prompt was to "make <a href="https://ypn.poetrysociety.org.uk/workshop/what-is-a-golden-shovel-with-peter-kahn/">a golden shovel</a>" from the<em> Poetry in the Time of Being Alone</em> group. I used a line from <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/09/24/try-to-praise-the-mutilated-world">this poem</a> for this one.

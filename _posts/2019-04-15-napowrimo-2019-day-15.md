<h2>Always More</h2>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>The sun sinks into the ocean<br />sending vivid indigos and ambers<br />to erupt like fireworks over the sky.<br />The water is a perfect mirror,<br />no horizon visible.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>We grade it two point three<br />out of five- could do better.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Reality isn't real enough.<br />Lost in somatic slumbers<br />we crave the perfect waves,<br />the right breeze over flawless skin<br />brighter colours, deeper saturation,<br />higher resolution than our eyes can process</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Always seeking rare sensations<br />to drown the silence deep.</p>

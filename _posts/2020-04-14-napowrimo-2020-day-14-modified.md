Purple clouds transform and jitter  
over the emerald sky. My limbs  
are sprawled over silicone grass  
as I observe butterflies flit in  
and out of existence. Everything  

is as it should be. Idly, I conduct  
the morning, my arm leaving blurs  
behind like a paintbrush. Memories  
of another world, similar to this  
one but seen through a petrol spill,  
congeal at the edges of my vision.  

<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="JsGRdQ">I shake my head free. Leave me here,  
</span><span class="JsGRdQ">in this field suffused with scents  
of burnt cinnamon, with the chimes  
of those distant crystalline waves.</span></p>  

<p class="_04xlpA direction-ltr align-start para-style-body"><span class="JsGRdQ">A soft rain falls, melting trees.</span></p>

Don't climb up those ancient stone steps  
carved into the slope of our tallest mountain  
up to that egg that sits on the summit,  
the size of a temple. You don't need  
to draw those eight strange instruments  
or watch them hover in the air before you  
to play a melody you always knew, no  
hands strumming strings, no breath over  
the reeds. You could simply stay here.  

Isn't it better to remain safe within  
the dreaming, even if it is not your own?  
Don't you want to leave the Wind Fish  
sleeping? I know you will tell me it is  
your destiny, whatever that word means,  
you bear the triangular mark after all.  
The legend will be retold another time  
in different lands, remote and distant.  

You and I will be similar but seen  
through convex mirrors, the same parts  
but remixed. So resist the urge to be  
a hero. Stay on this island built  
from the shimmer of surf and dreams.  
Linger a while by the regular waves.  
Let the story be passed to another.

Recently, I've been very lucky to have some writing accepted in a couple of different places.  

I am very pleased to have been featured in Neon' magazines Battery Pack, which features very short stories. I have a story called *Debugging report* in Battery Pack 3 and you can get it for free <a href="https://www.neonbooks.org.uk/portfolio/battery-pack-three/">here.</a>  

I also have a poem in* The Martian Wave 2018*, called *Beyond Darkness. *Find that <a href="https://nomadicdeliriumpress.com/blog/product/the-martian-wave-2018/">here.</a><br />

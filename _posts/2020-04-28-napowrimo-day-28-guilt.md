The sky is a confusion of clouds  
whereas just yesterday you could  
see the galaxy spin. We are out  
of coffee once again, the internet  
is often on the blink and helicopters  
are swarming day and night in hives.  
The oceans are swelling, drowning  
small coastal towns. The years are  
now dandelion seeds in a gale.  
I blink. Ten more have flown away.  
  
All of this feels like my fault  
somehow. I offer my hands as  
an apology. You close my fingers,  
pass them back to me, a gift.

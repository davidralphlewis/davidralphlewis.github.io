Ethereal  
  
The mists rolled in from the ocean  
quicker than any tidal wave,  
shrouding the shore in confusion.  
In seconds unaware sunbathers  
were swallowed up by cloud.  
  
And my mind was submerged.  
Neurons eaten by the fog. I was  
unable to see my hands  
or anything, except a constant  
wispy grey. I cannot know how long  
I was lost or how deep I sunk,  
forgotten by light. Hours or centuries  
  
until I emerged, lying in bed,  
confused by the gentle fingers of  
the sunrise stroking my cheek,  
a temporary beauty come to visit.

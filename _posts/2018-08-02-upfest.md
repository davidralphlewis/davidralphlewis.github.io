Houses have faded to grey. Colour slumbers.  
We drag our feet down monochrome  
streets, blinded by persistent monotony,  
unable to see the edge of the pavement  
or the bricks of the walls surrounding us.  
Corners are indistinct. We see only lead,  
tarmac and endless concrete, nothing more.  

Guided by gentle hands, faces emerge out of walls,  
fences, telephone boxes and empty billboards  
developing slowly, like a photographic negative,  
thriving like flowers in the cracks and ignored spaces,  
bending and yearning and opening to the light.  
They smile down on us, ghosts of those  
who never were, newly appointed guardians  
of the neighbourhood for the next year.  

They bring sweet saturation and strange patterns,  
cover the pavements in galaxies of paint flecks  
grow bright petals over doorways and windows,  
so we can see the buildings that surround us,  
and for a few moments we can laugh and dance,  
submerged in a new flood of technicolour.

Given the kindness and cruelty of time,  
a majority forgot those years where  
the tilt of the earth increased. Only  
a degree. Or more. Scientists spoke,  
we didn't listen, lost in our own panic,  
sick with adrenaline. Maybe others  
were able to convince themselves  
by repetition: It wasn't that bad. We  
pulled together. It wasn't that bad.  

What they omit is the months of still  
night, a numbness that never left,  
the dread- this situation was static,  
we had buried our normality with axes  
under the ice floes that spread arms  
down from the north, over city towers,  
consuming mountains, farms and futures.  
A new ice age. Mostly I woke, limbs numb,  
wondering how I would endure the day.  

I always did. And given enough days,  
even the glaciers melted and receded,  
leaving behind new altered landscapes,  
sun painted gifts for our patience.

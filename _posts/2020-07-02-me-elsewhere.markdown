Hello, here is where you can find me elsewhere on the internet:

* Tonight I will be reading a poem at the excellent [Bristol Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/). Online of course. My prompt was "Better machine than human", so the poem is very odd.<br />
<br />
* Tomorrow (Friday 3rd July) I will be virtually reading in the [K town Iso fest](https://www.facebook.com/groups/223923238968074/). I pre-recorded a couple of poems in some trees and it will be livestreamed at 5pm.<br />
<br />
* I have two strange poems in Selcouth Station's [debut webzine](https://www.selcouthstation.com/product-page/selcouth-magazine-1). It's only two pounds and is packed with great poetry and stories. Go support small presses!<br />
<br />
* Thank you, here is a marigold:

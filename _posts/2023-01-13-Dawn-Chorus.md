Blackbirds sing from the only tree    
left standing on land scrubbed clean.  
I am watching these buildings awake  
as hidden beaks and wings call to light;  

Come, illuminate this concrete plaza,  
turn our pavements holy. Cranes  
and scaffolding will be brass statues  
dipped in the rising sun. There's still  
a chance for this deforested city.  
The long night is never forever.

Today my mind is like confetti thrown  
to the wind, like a website with every  
space filled with adverts, all flashing  
for my attention, like a river delta  
as hundreds of tributaries race towards  
the ocean. Do you understand? It's like  
I've drunk ten espressos and all I can hear  
is the thumping house beat of my heart or  
like I am dust in the depths of the galaxy  
not yet ready to coalesce into planets.  
You must know what I mean. It's like I'm  
a beam of light shot through a prism,  
or my thoughts are cryptic crossword clues  
or I'm a CRT television stuck between  
channels, half images looping back over  
themselves. What I'm trying to say is  
I'm like a lizard darting across hot  
sands, it's like I'm caught in a washing  
machine near the end of the cycle, like  
I've become a comet entering the atmosphere  
before inevitably burning, disintegrating,  
becoming nothing more than fine ash rain.

I was very lucky to have a poem on BBC Radio Bristol's Upload show. The poem is called Encrypted and was written for <a href="https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=881907221970150&amp;ref=content_filter">Tonic</a>, which is an amazing night. You get given a prompt and you have a month to write a piece for it.  

The prompt I got was "threw postcards in the shape of airplanes hoping they get to where they meant to". It pushed the poem in strange new directions I never would have thought of if I was just sitting down to write without a prompt.  

Thanks to Chris Beale for recording it and Upload for broadcasting it. It is nationwide across the UK and is a fantastic initiative. I'd really recommend <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07xtgyr">sending something in</a>.  

<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07y148p">Listen here.</a> My poem is about an hour and a half in. It's on BBC Sounds until 23rd February.  

(Now <a href="https://youtu.be/tHAhnJbGy9M">this song</a> is in my head.)

*CW: Very brief allusion to suicidal thoughts*

The early bird catches the worm   
from a chain coffee shop, is rude  
and dismissive to the barista,  
pecks down the wriggling body  
and a double espresso before   
zipping off to a day of meetings  
and spreadsheets. The early bird  
meets all their deadlines, demands  
100 percent attendance at every meeting  
they organise, no excuses, blocks off  
time in a colour-coded, neat, hand-drawn  
calendar that they make every Sunday  
night in preparation for the week ahead.

If colleagues were asked to describe  
the early bird, they would use the words  
'brusque' or 'serious' or 'difficult to get on with'.  
They do not hear how fast the early bird's  
heart is beating, do not see how it swivels   
it's head all day to see what everyone else  
is doing. The early bird puts in long hours,   
is the first one into the office, the last  
one to leave. Exhaustion always wins though,  

so the early bird flies under amber   
street lights, guided in the dark by instinct,  
past lurid billboards and lairy groups  
of men in ties, back to it's nest,  
empty, wedged in a tree branch in   
the expensive part of the city. It settles  
itself down into the twigs and newspaper  
shavings and tries to block out all   
the emptiness around it, wonders  
what would happen if it just dropped  
and didn't even try to open it's wings  
before singing itself to sleep with songs  
its mother taught it long ago, on another   
continent as it's chest flutters  

too fast  
too loud.

This started as a writing exercise when you try to twist a cliche and developed into something different from there.

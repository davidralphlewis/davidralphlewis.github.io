<p>Plane trails cross the sky,<br />  
thin lines from one hub to another</p>  


  
<p>Small boats over the ocean<br />  
drag the same white trails behind.</p>  


  
<p>On a blank page, write out the names<br /> of everyone you've ever known<br /> even passing acquaintances and colleagues<br /> you haven't said a single word to. <br /> Then draw lines of connection.<br /> You will have a map of the cosmos<br /> and a diagram of an molecule.</p>  


  
<p>From above at night, the cities<br />  
towns, villages and roads are glowing<br />  
cells and veins. Grids are subsumed.<br />  
From above, the ground is a pictograph<br />  
of the inside of your skull.</p>  


  
<p>One strike sends sharp signals<br />  
to everyone. We all twitch and flinch.</p>  


  
<p>Somewhere within the network, you<br /> are a single synapse, one electrical<br /> spark dragging connection in its wake. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

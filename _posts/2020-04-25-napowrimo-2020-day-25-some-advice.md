I wouldn't open that door if I were you.  
Last year I stored the Atlantic ocean  
behind it, stuffed it into every corner.  
I only just managed to close the latch.  
If opened, the room will fill with brine,  
the house as well, the streets of this  
sea-level town all submerged and we will  
sink down to rest on the carpet below.  
  
I probably wouldn't open that door either.  
for you will see a short corridor, leading  
to another door, which leads to a short  
corridor, leading to yet another door-  
you get my point. After weeks you may  
turn back, to be faced with the same  
endless recursion of impossible doors.  
  
That's where I store my collection of  
nebulae and black holes, that one there  
leads straight to the hurricane hangar.  
  
Only the last one is out of bounds,  
the wooden door a foot high, there  
above the skirting board in the corner.  
I keep the key around my neck on a chain.  
It's alarmed, but you wouldn't know it.  
That's where I keep my worries. Inside,  
a cupboard of ink-stained shadows,  
paper torn into confetti, a whistling,  
quiet and high, with no visible origin.

Come sip the festive juice.  
It tastes of cinnamon, cloves,  
something strange you can't discern.  
Join us in the circle as we chant,  
*Tis the Season, Tis the Season*  

Feel your head expand and contract,  
like a blinking light on a tree.  
Watch as the world is delayed  
by half a second, maybe more.  
*Tis the Season, Tis the Season*  

Hear the chant continue like  
a runaway train, your mouth moving  
without thought, unstoppable now.  
Try to clench your jaw shut. Fail.  
*Tis the Season, Tis the Season*  

Understand, like falling from a cliff,  
this ritual is older than the holiday.  
older than the first human societies.  
Around fires, they called to the darkness  
*Tis the Season, Tis the Season*  

Leave your body far behind.  
Become one with us in the circle,  
unsure of where you end and begin,  
as we call to the cruel ancient god  
*Tis the Season, Tis the Season*

Thanks to The Bristol Magazine for the <a href="https://thebristolmag.co.uk/sip-the-festive-juice-with-bristol-syrup-co/">incredibly creepy headline</a> about cocktails, that was phrased in such an odd way I had to write this.

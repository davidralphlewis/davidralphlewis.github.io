* I'm very grateful to have a poem up on *Nine Muses Poetry* called *Imposter*. It's a strange little piece and I'm glad it's found a good home. Check it out [here](https://ninemusespoetry.com/2020/05/14/one-poem-by-david-ralph-lewis/)

* One of my poems *Hollow Passengers* was also set to an awesome improvised soundtrack by Charlie and Jake as part of their Echoes and Edges live stream. It's such a cool collaborative project and one of the best uses of technology I've seen. Check it out below or click through for timings. I recommend watching it all as the whole project is very inventive.

* I'm going to be (virtually) on their live stream again this Saturday 16th. Go to [their site](www.echoesandedges.co.uk) for more details and links on how to watch.
* Stay safe everyone.

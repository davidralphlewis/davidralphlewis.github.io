We have seen millions of years  
stacked upon another in sediment  
history etched into the stone,   
outlines and skeletons of creatures  
beyond imagination who used  
to claim this planet as their own.  
We have wandered far from light  
covered our hands in ochre dust  
and pressed them into the walls  
to leave a mark for those following.  

We have roamed away from our home   
plains, seen towering trees that are  
the earth breathing, lakes turned to  
rock by angry gods, high mountains  
where they sit and argue our fates.  

We have noticed the wheat rising  
along well worn paths and so  
we have pressed ears into the soil  
and seen how it rises yearly, light  
transformed into food. We have  
planted rows, built shelters to tend  
our crops and in this way we have  
taken control of nature and the future.  

We have seen villages, towns and empires  
rise from dust and collapse back  
into the wind. We have seen ships  
defy the impossible and float on   
waves to other lands. We have seen faces  
revealed in pigment or excavated  
from the cool marble. We have invented  
codes using simple lines and have read  
all the myriad, longing voices of the dead.  

We have created so much suffering.  
Ore raised from the ground, under   
heat and rage transformed into blades.  
Into bullets. We have claimed whole lands  
under fantasies of flags, considered  
men and women to be products and   
transported them across oceans,   
spread plagues with gifts of blankets.  

We have seen strange machines  
automatons that play invented games,  
engines that carve up the landscape,  
glowing screens that transport us   
to other worlds. We have seen rockets  
blaze beyond morning, seen the sun  
rise over the horizon on other planets.  

We have seen waves rise higher,  
fires unleashed, destroying forests,  
skies orange and thick with smoke,  
mercury rising too fast, winters no   
longer full of snow. We know this  
to be our fault as we huddle together,  
hoping we will be here to see more.  

The rock under our feet tells us nothing.

This was written for the wonderful [Bristol Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/) event last night. The prompt was the title "We have seen things."

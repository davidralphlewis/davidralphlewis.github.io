Were you the stranger dressed in electricity  
who floated above the tarmac without contact,  
who smiled in morse code, smelled of lavender  
and engine oil, who spoke in rapid static bursts  
which I understood to be secrets never spoken?   
Did you splinter my sternum, peer inside to find  
distant storms and lightning brewing? Did you fold  
yourself into the air and vanish, entering the unseen  
creases of reality as easily as catching a bus?  
Were your irises burnt into the pavement for days?    
Please respond to me if so, I have your wallet.

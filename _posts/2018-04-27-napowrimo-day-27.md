## Dance  

At the start, a needle dropped  
in the darkness and all the nothing  
spun, starting up the groove.  

Quarks were the first to join,  
swaying to rhythm of a relaxed  
cha-cha-cha, joining together  
in new partnerships, forging  
protons, neutrons, even jitterbugging  
electrons, all whirling as one  
as the music got faster.  

Particles were synchronized  
in the jive and more and more  
rushed to the floor, making atoms  
which cut loose and pulled shapes  

until gases, then stars, even planets  
were twisting and shimmying  
strutting and skipping,  
swinging each other round,  
lost in an eternal tango,  
a boundless fox-trot,  
an infinite conga,  
as the universe got down  
to the songs of the spheres.

Miss Morris asked us to bring something special  
in and talk about it in front of the class  
for everyone else to share and enjoy  
and so in this cardboard box I have brought   
the first rays of morning and if I open it  
this classroom, with its peeling walls,   
its desks engraved with cramped insults    
and declarations of love from children   
who have now become adults, its blutacked   
posters of the alphabet, all we can see will   
transform into gold and all our eyes will  
glitter and all the dust in the spaces    
between us will dance and twirl in the light.

I wrote this one during the half time of [Bristol Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic), from the prompt *Show and Tell.* Thanks again to them.

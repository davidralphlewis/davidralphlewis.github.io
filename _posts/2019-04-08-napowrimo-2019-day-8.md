<h2>Remnants of Shock</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Withered branches, bony fingers,<br />scrape a sea of forever cloud.<br />Ash falls in soft snow clumps, <br />embracing land with quiet tenderness. </p>  


  
<p>Look down, to where knotted roots<br />erupt from the carpet of grey. <br />Imperceptible at first, your eyes<br />adjust: new scattered flecks of green.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

<h2>Aeolus</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>You would not know me in this form.<br />My face shifts and is never still<br />like the empty dunes that whistle<br />so sweetly or the swaying branches.<br />If inclined, I will fill your sails<br />with the steady direction of home,<br />and help your seeds scatter over soil.</p>  


  
<p>But my origins and allegiances can change.<br />Within a cloth bag, I keep my rage.<br />Do not provoke me or otherwise<br />I will untie the intricate knot<br />and watch your houses take flight. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

I'm delighted to have a poem included in an anthology of poems inspired by Twin Peaks, called *<a href="https://www.apeppublications.com/product/these-poems-are-not-what-they-seem/">These Poems are Not What They Seem,</a>* published by APEP publications. My poem is called *We're gonna keep her out of it* and draws inspiration from Sarah Palmer and the character of Judy in the return. It's also about rumours.  

The anthology out March 7th and is available for preorder now. It's a US publication though, so check shipping costs.  

I also read my poem as part of Performance Anxiety, a monthly reading on skype. You can listen below. I'm the token Brit.

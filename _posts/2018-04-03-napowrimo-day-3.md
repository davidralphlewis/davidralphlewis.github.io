## Apologise  

Fine, I’m sorry I punched you  
hard in the eye just now.  
But you walked in front of my fist-  
What did you expect?  

I’m also sorry for pouring gallons of oil,  
and hectares of plastic into the oceans,  
transforming the water into poison.  
But, really, the fish were too stupid  
to protest or even walk on land.  
So in a way it’s their fault.  

And yes, I’m sorry for setting up  
a national surveillance network of  
cameras, motion sensors, microphones  
thermal imagers, informants and secret police.  
to watch your every move from the morning  
to when your close your eyes, ‘alone’ in bed.  
But really if you had nothing to hide  
there is no problem. Why be annoyed?  

I’m sorry if you were offended by my actions.

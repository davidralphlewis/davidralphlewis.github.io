They sometimes shine torches over the strata  
of compressed time, with sweeping, shaking  
hands. Eternity is present in their half smiles. 

He carries a sadness for a long dead myth  
that he longs to bury in the river far below.   

She longs for a bridge in the same way you   
want to win the lottery but never buy a ticket.   

They talk in clouds that never quite merge.   
Unnoticed by them both, in the shadows,   

a man sits at a piano and plays Debussy,   
the notes falling and fading into red dust.   

This isn't a climax to a Nora Ephron film.  
They avoid eye contact. Later, she will text him  
'I searched for your flashlight but got lost.'  

Night falls across the mesa like a stone  
bouncing off a cliff into the welcoming earth.

Sorry to the people I saw who inspired this poem. I'm sure you were having a perfectly nice time in reality. 

I was experimenting with consistency of images here. Not sure it fully works, but I liked some of the lines.

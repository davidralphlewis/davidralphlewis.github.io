<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Walking alone at night, gravity<br />  
increases. You are dragged downwards<br />  
towards the shivering planet. Your air<br />  
becomes a compressing accordian.<br />  
The sky is a finger tip stretch away.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  
  
<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>Halt and crane your neck upwards. See<br />  
a section of infinity sprawled before you.<br />  
Don't you know this starlight has rushed<br />  
as fast as possible, for millions of years<br />  
to reach your eyes? Look closely </p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  
  
<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>to see the start of everything.</p>

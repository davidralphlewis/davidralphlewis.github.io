<h2>Observations in the Dark</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Walking alone at night, gravity<br />  
increases. You are dragged downwards<br />  
towards the shivering planet. Your air<br />  
becomes a compressing accordian.<br />  
The sky is a finger tip stretch away.</p>  


  
<p>Halt and crane your neck upwards. See<br />  
a section of infinity sprawled before you.<br />  
Don't you know this starlight has rushed<br />  
as fast as possible, for millions of years<br />  
to reach your eyes? Look closely </p>  


  
<p>to see the start of everything.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

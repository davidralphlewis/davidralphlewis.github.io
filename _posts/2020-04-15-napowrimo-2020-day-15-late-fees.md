<em>CW: death</em>  

Your library is now scattered.  
Yellowing paperbacks you found  
by chance in second-hand markets,  
hardbacks with messages inscribed  
on the first page, the much read,  
the dogeared, the pristine copies,  
the underlined, all now are removed  
from your shelves and returned back  
to the world. Those words were always  
loaned. Given the absence of you,  
the catalogue that arranged the spines,  
we dispersed piles to charity shops,  
disintegrated each memory and each  
sentimental gift. Your neurons too,  
were always borrowed, now separated  
into atoms and thrown back into  
the wild universe, to be reused or  
discarded or recombined into new  
words, new combinations, new life.

Prompt was "object permanence" in the <em>Poetry in the time of being alone</em> group. Halfway through!

In previous years I've written <a href="/2016-the-year-the-internet-took-over/">rambly</a>, <a href="/2017-review-laughing-naked-emperor/">angry</a> blog posts that tried to make sense of the world around me and mostly failed. This year I've given up trying to understand the world and instead have written a poem to sum up the year:<br />  

<h2>2018 in Review</h2>  

This year was a bullet fired from a shaking hand,<br />screaming as it ripped the air in half<br />then burying itself deep into an essential organ.<br />Or maybe two. It was hard to tell with all the viscera.<br /><br />This year we all turned to stone.<br />In many ways, it was a relief to be immobile<br />until we had an urge to scratch ourselves.<br /><br />I did not spend enough time this year listening<br />to the whispers of the wind and the waves.<br /><br />This year was full of half finished questions <br />none of which had anything resembling an answer.<br />We never stopped screaming them at each other.<br />At half-past three in the morning we would bellow<br />What now? Have you heard-? Can you believe-?<br /><br />This year we noticed how fast the water was rising<br />but we were frozen in granite and marble<br />so we justified a fluid grave to ourselves<br />saying it was what we wanted all along.<br /><br />All my goals this year were scrawled onto receipts<br />which I then tossed behind my shoulder,<br />carried on walking and never looked at again.<br /><br />This year was a train derailing in slow motion,<br />a thousand frames a second so we could see<br />all the gory detail right there on the big screen.<br />There was no pause button. We just had to watch. <br />

Thanks to the lovely audience at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LOTMPoetry/">Lines of the Mind</a> for listening to this one when I read it out a couple of weeks ago.  

In the next couple of weeks I'll look at my favourite pop culture I encountered this year which is frankly more important than all this political nonsense. In the meantime, here's my picks from <a href="https://davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2017/">2017 </a>and from <a href="https://davidralphlewis.co.uk/best-of-2016/">2016.</a><br /><br />

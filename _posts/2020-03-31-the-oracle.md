Forgive me, I have lost my lexicon  
of the future. Now I search the tangled  
entropy of brambles and bindweed.  
Nothing useful emerges, only woodlice.    

Clouds no longer spell out predictions,  
don't merge or drift into forgotten faces  
or arrows, indicating the way forward.  

These tea leaves do not show patterns,  
just transmit random letters through  
flecks settling in cups, stewed static.  

I scry daily but my mind is a broken  
telescope array. Like every person  
now I stumble forward in ignorance.  
I ask the stars for guidance. No reply.

I've just noticed it's April tomorrow [^1] so I guess I'll be doing a poem a day from tomorrow. Consider yourself warned.

<pre style="color:white;">
we teach the AI how              we scream
feed it all our voices           alone
release all our agony            our grief
our childhood trauma             buried fears
our compressed nightmares        absorbed
into passive microphones         into the night

it runs iterations so fast       it echoes back
Our grunts our exhalations       distorted
an angelic choir united          strange harmony

Written during a Red Sky Session with Apples and Snakes, this was a response to a music loop by Bellatix.

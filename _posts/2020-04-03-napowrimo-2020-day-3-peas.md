It's still magic.  
The emergence  
of green from  
damp soil, adder  
head coiling up,  
before unfurling,  
saluting the sun.  
  
We transplant small  
miracles outside,  
cross our fingers,  
hope they survive.  
  
Four weeks scatter  
like dandelion seeds.  
No new shoots grasp  
bamboo for support.  
Slugs circle, waiting.  
  
Without warning, a glut of blessings,  
sweet excess, shock of sudden pods,  
hiding the orbs of light within.  
We eat them raw, tongues rejoicing.  
  
The wind blows colder.  
We split dried husks,  
store spherical spells  
in envelopes labelled  
in pencil and wait for  
the return of the sun.

<h2>Ordinary Omens</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Thousands of seagulls descended<br />  
yesterday on one street corner.<br />  
The air was thick with wings,<br />  
No-one thought it strange.</p>  


  
<p>We are a cracked river bed<br />  
just before it dries out,<br />  
water still barely flowing,<br />  
leaving rock and rust deposits<br />  
snaking down bare hillside.</p>  


  
<p>Lead and mercury storm clouds<br />  
appear overhead in seconds.<br />  
We dodge and weave between<br />  
rains of first generation iPods,<br />  
avoid fax machine strikes.</p>  


  
<p>Streams run green with lithium.<br />  
We breathe in chlorine and<br />  
we are grateful for it.</p>  


  
<p>While we still can, let us lie<br /> in our broken glass gardens and<br /> sing to each other; songs of jetpacks,<br /> cties that float on the ocean<br /> and escalators to the moon.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

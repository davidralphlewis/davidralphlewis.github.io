<h2>Tempest</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  


<p>When storm clouds spell put your name,<br />  
it's hard not to take it personally.<br />  
Shifting letters, miles high, grow heavy<br />  
and dark as they fill the sky.</p>  



<p>Sunshine appears in patches, a <br />  
mismatched jigsaw. When you step in,<br />  
it flickers and fades, the fuse board blown.</p>  



<p>Rain, when it decides to fall,<br />  
seeks you out, small homing missiles,<br />  
following your frantic steps down the street.<br />  
As it slams into your ears, soaks through<br />  
your cheap anorak, it whispers threats,<br />  
drawn from details you only told notebooks<br />  
and kept buried in a locked drawer.</p>  



<p>Do not think of lightning.<br />  
There are times when bolts are thrown<br />  
almost at your feet and you jump<br />  
and weave to avoid being struck.</p>  



<p>Go where people pool and flow.<br />  
Look up. More clouds metamorphose,<br />  
more than you ever noticed before.<br />  
Each person glances at their own squall<br />  
as it follows them, unwavering.<br />  
A stranger beckons you under an umbrella.<br />  
Stand still together and be dry.</p>  


<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

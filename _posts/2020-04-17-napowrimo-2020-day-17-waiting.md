My former body is discarded over  
a plastic chair, abandoned to  
numbness. Now I am these walls,  
the vending machine in the corner  
humming its constant mantra,  
the flicker of that strip light  
spelling out a morse code psalm,  
the runes of mould creeping over  
each ceiling tile. Aeons vanish.  
  
I try to affect some small change.  
Three thousand years or thereabouts  
pushing at the door, another hundred  
attempting to disturb the leaflets  
which remain stubbornly motionless.  
So this is eternity, the room thinks,  
still, peaceful and yet repellent.

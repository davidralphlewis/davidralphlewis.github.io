<h2>Seduction</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>The past whispers in your ear<br /> when sleep seems so distant<br /> with tales and promises told<br /> in sweet singing tones<br /> "Society was better then,<br /> if only you could go back."</p>  


  
<p>Still humming a forgotten tune<br /> it pulls you out of the bed<br /> and towards the floorboards<br /> where the sour and sweet smell<br /> rises from underneath. "Damp<br /> has set into the bones now,<br /> nothing left but a slow descent<br /> into disorder and anarchy.<br /> If only you could go back."</p>  


  
<p>Lies, of course. The rot<br />  
doesn't exist and neither<br />  
did that soft golden light<br />  
of a perfect childhood. All we <br />  
have is now, always vanishing.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

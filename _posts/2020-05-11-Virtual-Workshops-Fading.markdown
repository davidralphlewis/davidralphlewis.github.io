I joined a virtual poetry workshop yesterday run by the wonderful [Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/bristoltonic) and wrote this:

## Fading

Singing soft chimes under her breath, she  
kisses each ear of wheat, borrows   
yellow from sunflower petals before   

smearing each cloud with evening, takes   
indigo from the blackberries, then stops,   
not satisfied with her canvas. Sighing, she  
grabs a cherry blossom and erases the day   
showing the countless stars behind, waiting.   

It was an acrostic and pastoral workshop. Working within those constraints was really challenging but really useful. By limiting myself, it challenged the language and patterns I usually fall into when making poetry.  

One of the very few advantages of lockdown has been the proliferation of live streamed poetry events. It means I've been able to attend a few more than I would do normally and from a wider area. I took part in an online slam the other day with the hosts based in Swindon, which would be too far for me to go for a night in oridnary life.

It's a bitter blessing. Nothing beats being in a room with other people but this is the next best thing.

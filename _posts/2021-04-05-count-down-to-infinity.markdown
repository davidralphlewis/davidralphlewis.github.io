I'm working front desk at the Hilbert Hotel.<br>		 		
A queue of guests stretches to the horizon,<br>  	  	 	
each person sighing, waiting to check out.<br>		 	
Some leave but the number never goes down.<br>		  
No matter how quickly I work, more remain.<br> 		 	 	
The amount of disgruntled guests is infinite.<br>	 			

The final bills I print out are infinite.<br> 	  			
(Minibars never run empty in this hotel.)<br> 		 	
I take one payment. Countless more remain,<br>  	 			
credit card receipts spool to the horizon.<br>	 			
The printer paper never seems to run down,<br> 	 		
clock hands never seem to count me out.<br>			 

I do not allow my annoyance to come out<br> 		 	
even though this working shift is infinite.<br>   			
I smile, am professional, get my head down,<br> 	  			
focus on my excellent service at this hotel,<br>  	  		
occasionally stare out towards the horizon,<br>			 	
wondering how may crawling hours remain.<br>  			 

My boss sighs at how many people remain.<br> 			 
I know they long to shout and call me out	<br>  		 	
but instead they wander to the horizon <br> 				 
to attend to residents, who are infinite.<br>			 
We are always at capacity at this hotel,<br>  	 
my boss never has a chance to sit down.<br> 		 	

On my first shift I got lost, wandered down<br>    			
corridors of rooms where customers remain,<br> 		 		
roamed the endless hallways of this hotel,<br>  		 		
unable to recall which direction was out.<br> 			 
The numbers on the wood doors were infinite<br>	 		
'Do not disturb' signs fading to the horizon.<br>	 			

I long for the wind, to see the horizon<br>			 
of the ocean, to go to the shore, sit down,<br>	 		
hear waves lapping, eternal and infinite,<br>			 
count all the grains of sand that remain,<br>		 
just be for a while and breathe out,<br>				 
but I am trapped in this cursed hotel.<br>			 	

My dreams are infinite with no horizon,<br>		 	
yearning for this hotel to crumble down.<br>	 		
But still customers remain. I never walk out.<br>

Wrote this for Bristol Tonic. It was a fun excuse to mess around with form and try something a little different.

## Gleaming  

Everything is precious in this early light.  
A fox shuffles between discarded kebabs,  
with shimmering fur, golden and new.  
A high-rise, shining, is a forgotten temple.  
Glass shards scattered over the pavement  
are countless stars, illuminating the tarmac.  
Emerald leaves grow from amber branches  
to shine on us both, staggering stragglers,  
almost home, with the rarest crystals for eyes.  
Overnight, this city was built again out of silver,  
just for me and you, my sapphire love.

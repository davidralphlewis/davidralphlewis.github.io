"I know how this goes!" I say to no-one  
as light starts to intensify, obliterating  
all detail. Trees will become indistinct  
shapes in the mist, never coalescing  
into objects. The grass will flicker  
with blue fire sparks, but that will  
be the least of my problems. Walls,  
so dependable and solid, will become  
transparent as the hungry light feeds.  

"Bring it on!" I will shout towards the  
rapidly dissolving sky. "So predictable!  
You're not even trying!" I will scream  
as the outline of my body transforms  
into scattered pencil smudges, as my  
carbon is disassembled, as I become  
the cyclone. "C minus!!" I will shout,  
"Unlucky, try a lot harder next time!"

Prompt was the first line "I know how this goes..." from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/applesandsnakes/">Apples and Snakes</a>. They are also doing some great readings over on their youtube channel, so check those out.

## Found  

We lost you there momentarily.  
You rambled outside the borders  
of yourself. There is no map,  
no GPS to locate your lost  
and wandering thoughts.  

Where do we go in those inbetween  
times? It was only a minute,  
maybe two. One moment at your desk,  
the next outside, sitting by a tree.  
Where did your mind roam, while your  
body navigated the world blind?  

Welcome back from the unknown.  
Have a look around, it's all yours.  
Each second created sparkling new.  
A discovery hidden in each instant:  
Clouds drifting like unmoored boats,  
Grass gently rippling like waves,  
The strangeness of each calm breath.

Summer has flown away, the trees are turning and autumn has hit with a punch overnight. All of a sudden it's a bit grim outside and we hunker down, gather straw around us and hibernate until winter. Ah well, here's some things that I enjoyed in September, and you might too:  

* Had <a href="http://donmarquis.org/themoth.html">this</a> poem by Don Marquis flagged for a long time, but finally got round to reading it. Not much to say, other than it's great. Can't remember how I found it, but I know very little about the poet and their work.  
* <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/09/andrew-sullivan-technology-almost-killed-me.html">This</a> article by Andrew Sullivan about reconnecting with yourself in an age of distraction has been everywhere and with good reason. He makes a compelling case for slowing down and stopping the rush of information:

  We almost forget that ten years ago, there were no smartphones, and as recently as 2011, only a third of Americans owned one. Now nearly two-thirds do. That figure reaches 85 percent when youâ€™re only counting young adults. And 46 percent of Americans told Pew surveyors last year a simple but remarkable thing: They could not live without one. The device went from unknown to indispensable in less than a decade.   

I often struggle with this myself. I have found value in single tasking, in reducing the amount of information and focusing more on what i want to rad. The problem is with all knowledge ever at our fingertips, it's hard to control that.  


* <a href="https://londonhollywood.wordpress.com/2016/09/22/if-you-read-only-one-alan-moore-jerusalem-interview-make-it-this-one/">This</a> really long Alan Moore interview is absolutely worth it. Really fascinating read about one of the most interesting writers around.  
* Speaking of writing, <a href="http://www.cnet.com/technically-literate/eros/">this</a> creepy story from cnet is a well written, well thought-out sci-fi story about a world where love can be brought and sold as a drug.  
* Creativity is a muscle, you just have to use it. Like practising scales or writing every day, good things happen when you decide to work every day on a project. You get better over time. It is ably proven by <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/10-things-i-learned-by-doodling-for-100-days-straight-a802753c5a25#.8lwjrvdmy">this</a> great post of John Cutler who decided to doodle every day. I find the drawings fascinating and his analysis is spot on.  

That's it for now. Enjoy the darkening skies

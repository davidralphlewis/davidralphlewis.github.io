Fresh frost has visited overnight,   
morning shudders, barely starts   
Our fallow fields now writhe with blight.   
Fresh frost has visited overnight,   
We have lost colour from our sight-   
like fools, we hold hope in our hearts.   
Fresh frost has visited overnight,   
morning shudders, barely starts.

I'm moving house this month and I released [a pamphlet](/refraction/), so it's all been a bit frantic. Still, here are some things I've enjoyed engaging with this month.

## Article
[Vanessa Kissule](https://www.penguin.co.uk/articles/2020/october/a-poem-is-a-pot-noodle-at-the-stroke-of-midnight.html?s=09) writes about how poetry should be for everyone and how it is a transformative break:

> Poetry stretches our ability to process the abstract, to reconcile with that which is and simultaneously isnâ€™t. It is the wonderland in which contradiction is not just accepted but welcomed. There is a growing appetite for social media content that stokes nuanced response over dramatic spikes of dopamine or cortisol. A transformative poem demands we sit with an image and view it from this angle, then another and another.

## Book

With everything going on, it's a delight to escape into a rich fantasy world. [*The Starless Sea*](https://www.hive.co.uk/Product/Erin-Morgenstern/The-Starless-Sea--the-spellbinding-Sunday-Times-bestseller/24934386) by Erin Morgenstern understands this escape into fiction as a necessity. It's a delight from start to finish, with stories stacked upon stories and a deep world below. It's brilliant.

## Poem

I've started limiting my social media usage, because I tend to get caught in a doomscrolling twitchy loop, but one of the things that keeps me on is #toptweetTuesday, where poets share a poem they are proud of and provide lovely feedback. It's hosted by Black Bough Poetry and is one of the highlights of this week. Ankh Spice, (aka @seagoatscreams) is a consistent highlight and [this is one of his most beautiful poems](https://twitter.com/SeaGoatScreams/status/1320987206282956802), a reminder of being alive.

## Video
Exurb1a's video on the nature of consciousness and qualia reduces a complex philosophical topic into a fascinating and entertaining fifteen minute video.

## Podcast
[Secretly Incredibly Fascinating](https://play.acast.com/s/secretly-incredibly-fascinating) is a dive each week into a mundane topic with interesting background and facts. It's entertaining, educational and host Alex Schmidt's curiosity for every detail is infectious.
## Music

Four Tet's new album is equally complex and relaxing. I've sunk into it this month.

Once again, you find yourself barefoot,   
toes buried in eroded stone, your steps  
hesitant, sinking. You stand at the edge  
of your island, listening to my breathing,  
the crash and retreat, the regular shingle  
sigh, the dance of a million small particles  
rearranging themselves in new patterns.   
The sun is already setting, elongating   
your shadow, making me shimmer gold and  
jewel tipped. You breathe in my salt air. 

Once again. you have found your feet uncertain,  
untethered to the land you live in. You have  
been drifting like morning mist, over footpaths  
and stiles, your destination unclear. You have   
been translucent, with ill defined borders.  
So you find yourself in front of me,   
walking forwards as wind ripples your chest.  
I am cold but you stay anyway. I can feel   
each small leg hair standing surprised. 

Let me take your burdens, the ones you have carried  
for so long now without realising. As you  
wade further in, let me hold your intrusive   
thoughts, your vague worries. Let me wash  
the soil and land from your skin. Float now.   
Lie on your back, starfished. Float.  
Forget all the regular thoughts and patterns   
you loosely define as a self. Let them drift,  
become diffuse and bob towards the horizon.   
Float now, forgetting who or where you are.  

Once again the sun sits and light fades.  
Once again you have to pull your limbs  
together, become something like a person,   
define the boundaries of your being.   
Of course, you can't stay here forever.  
Once again, you pull on wrinkled cotton,  
shock of small scratches over skin.   
With a sigh, I regift your problems to you,  
not solved, but buffed clean and polished,  
shining smooth glass. Return to me    
with anything you wish to bring   
more into light, anything you wish to define.  
I will be waiting here, lapping the land,  
speaking in susurrations to the sandstone and the shore.

<p>I ask the rain for answers<br />  
but it offers no reply,<br />  
just a gentle tip tip tap<br />  
annointing my forehead.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>I want to speak the same words<br />  
as the indifferent sun<br />  
or babble with the brooks<br />  
in quiet flowing tones.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>So much remains unknown.<br /> In thousands of lifetimes<br /> we may, together, learn a word<br /> of an infinite lexicon.</p>  
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->  

<!-- wp:paragraph -->  
<p>I try to converse with the wind<br />  
but it does not answer back.<br />  
With soft and tender hands<br />  
it ruffles through my hair.</p>

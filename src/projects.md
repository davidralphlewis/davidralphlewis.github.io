# Projects

Larger things I have out in the world. Most of the books are available for free download. No email address or anything required, just click through

## Short Stories

- [Amber Stars: One Night of Stories](/amberstars/) is the first book of short stories I wrote, all set in one night in a small town. Free download.

## Poetry

- [Our Voice in the Chaos](/ourvoicesinthechaos/) was my first pamphlet originally published by *Selcouth Station*, mixing blackout poetry and normal poetry to show the collapse of society. Free download.
- [Spare Parts](/spareparts/) was a collaboration with M. Amelia Eilki. She wrote flash fiction and I created blackout poetry from it.
- [Refraction](/refractionpamphlet/) is a micro pamphlet about swimming. Free download.
- [Reality Adjustments](/reality-adjustments/) A small interactive poetry pamphlet written in TWINE, about a city that is always changing. Free to play[here.](https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments)

## Plays

- [Remain Vigilant](/remainvigilant/) In another life, I did a playwriting course. This was the only thing I am still proud of in that time. Free download.

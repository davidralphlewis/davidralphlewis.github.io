# Projects

Larger things I have out in the world. Most of the books are available for free download. No email address or anything required, just click through

## Short Stories

- [Amber Stars: One Night of Stories](/amberstars/) is the first book of short stories I wrote, all set in one night in a small town. Free download.

## Poetry

- [Our Voice in the Chaos](/ourvoicesinthechaos/) was my first pamphlet originally published by *Selcouth Station*, mixing blackout poetry and normal poetry to show the collapse of society. Free download.
- [Spare Parts](/spareparts/) was a collaboration with M. Amelia Eilki. She wrote flash fiction and I created blackout poetry from it.
- [Refraction](/refractionpamphlet/) is a micro pamphlet about swimming. Free download.
- [Reality Adjustments](/reality-adjustments/) A small interactive poetry pamphlet written in TWINE, about a city that is always changing. Free to play [here.](https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments)
- [Emergence](https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/product/emergence)- A poetry pamphlet based around the idea of panpsychicism, or consciousness as an emergent property of the universe. An excuse to mess around with form. Still got a few left, link takes you to the shop.

## Mini Zines 

I've made a few little zines as a way of making something from poems.

- [How not to make things perfectly](/assets/books/imperfect-zine.pdf) - (Direct pdf download) - A very quick zine about making things quickly. More details and the text of the zine [here.](/posts/how-not-to-make-things-perfectly/)
- [G Man](/assets/books/g-man-zine.pdf) (Direct pdf download) - Weird poem about an ancient pagan deity being tortured by a shadowy government agency. I like performing this one.
- [Poetry Dice Zine](/assets/books/Poetry-Dice-Zine.pdf) (Direct pdf download) - Zine about making poems from dice rolls as a quick warm up exercise. Post is [here](/posts/2024-06-22-quick-dice-poetry-exercise/)
- [Quota](/assets/books/quota-zine.pdf) (Direct pdf download) - Another weird poem, this time about climate change. Made with rubber stamps and red ink.
- [Serenity Study](/assets/books/serenity-study-zine.pdf)- Old zine I made during the pandemic. About things that bring me peace.
- [Tubers](/assets/books/tubers-zine.pdf) Weird potato poem on a5. This prints two zines on a4 double sided, with printing on the short edge. 

## Plays

- [Remain Vigilant](/remainvigilant/) In another life, I did a playwriting course. This was the only thing I am still proud of in that time. Free download.

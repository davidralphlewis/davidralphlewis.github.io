A unique combination of blackout poetry and normal poetry, <em>Our Voices in the Chaos</em> is my debut poetry chapbook, originally published in September 2019 by *Selcouth Station*. 

In these blackout poems, you will be drawn into the maddening chaos of the world and find your own voices singing within. It deals with ghosts, anxiety and complete societal collapse, but with glimmers of hope strewn throughout like the stars in the empty night sky.

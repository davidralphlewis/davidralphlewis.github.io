<p> A small micropamphlet of poetry  made during lockdown, when I was missing the sea. I self-published it in a limited physical run in October 2020.</p>

<p> It features ten poems about swimming and the peace I find immersing myself in water. (There is another, secret meaning; trying to find moments of calm in a relentless, chaotic world.)</p>

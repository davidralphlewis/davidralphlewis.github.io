Pious parsons pass pyres,  
proclaim pretty prayers,  
preach possessed portents.  

Paratroopers portion parcels,  
permit parsimony, paucity,  
protect providence.  

Police poach previous privacy,  
pass physical perturbation-  
plead politely.  

Priveledges perish. Pinch  
peace, periodically.  
Proliferate philanthropy.  

People possess perseverance.  
postpone panic. Patience.  
Potential pervades.

Prompt was 'P' from <em>Poetry at the time of being alone</em> group.

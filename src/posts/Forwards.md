Wind whispers insults down the chimney-  
all your failures as a husband, friend, human  

You pull on Gore-Tex.  
Rustle as you walk.  

A meteorological mystery- This storm   
has squatted overhead for weeks.  

You pull on rubber boots.    
Open your front door.  

The cold hits your exposed cheek   
followed by countless raindrops,   
each delivering possible disasters.  

You pull each foot forward.  
Soon, one step follows another,  
squelching in saturated mud  
over mist drowned fields,  
looping to where you began

You repeat this daily  
letting the weeks fall  
like dying leaves  
until one day you glance up  
poke a gap in the clouds

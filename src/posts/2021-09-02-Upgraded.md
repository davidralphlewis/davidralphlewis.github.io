I have a poem up on the wonderful *Ink, Sweat and Tears!* Thanks so much to them for featuring it. It's called *Ceasefire* and is a little more grim than usual. [Find it here](https://inksweatandtears.co.uk/david-ralph-lewis/)

I'm glad things are opening up again. I performed at a real life open mic last week and it was glorious. The downside of actually being around people is that I caught a cold for the first time in about two years. I'm just glad it wasn't Covid.

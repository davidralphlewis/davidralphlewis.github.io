## Discovery  

After crossing the vast nothingness,  
months trapped in a steel coffin  
with inches between us and death,  
we crashed into the red dust.  

After scrambling out of the air lock,  
still protected from the dubious air,  
each in our own plastic cocoon,  
we crept along the hostile surface.  

After setting up our insignificant camp,  
the awe set in. We were the first  
to cross the darkness, to stand  
on a different planet and see the same sun.  

After conducting initial experiments,  
we walked the perimeter of the crater  
until we stumbled on a human skull,  
quite fossilised, buried among the red rocks.

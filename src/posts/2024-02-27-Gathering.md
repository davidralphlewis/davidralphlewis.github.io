We are racing against the dying of the day    
over fields flooded with twigs and silence  
towards a broiling bruise left by a canula,   
our tinny engine whine now a mosquito.   

As we approach, the cloud swallows the sky  
becomes a mountain, navy blue, with illuminated    
golden caves. Above our heads it towers,    
an impossible island on this empty plain. 

We hold our breaths close, cling to them   
like driftwood. As we drive into the dark   
rain hammers down onto our metal shell    
in a frenzy,  yearning for destruction.

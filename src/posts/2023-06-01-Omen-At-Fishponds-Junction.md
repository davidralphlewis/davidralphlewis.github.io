Down the central reservation he strode,   
unbothered by exhaust fumes or concrete, 
face encased in a leather mask.

I was idling in my ordered world  
watching gridlock for signs of movement,  
*Lifeblood* on my Micra's stereo.  

He stared at me, eyes covered   
by stitched holes, mine shielded   
by sunshade and plexiglass,  
raised a single finger towards   
the broiling, pyretic sky  

and marched onwards, message delivered.   
My spine became a melting glacier.   
I opened the passenger door, left    
my laptop and future on the hard shoulder    
as traffic crawled to the bear pit.

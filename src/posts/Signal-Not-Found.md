Elm trunk picked out in mustard.  
The suggestion of erased branches.   
Light only falls so far.  

Distant towns lurk below horizons.  
Behind navy fog, satellites drop forever.  
The wind issues static whispers  

challenging my place in the swirl.  
Dank seeps into cheap trainers.   
I watch myself shiver in wool.  

Even the main road is hushed.  
Beyond tree boundaries I know  
mud flows into fallow fields;  

owls wait to catch the unaware;  
across the void, on wire and waves  
other bodies are watching the dark.  

Knowledge only falls so far.   
I stare up into churning vapour  
try to catch faint radio hisses.

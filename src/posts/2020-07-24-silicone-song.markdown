Taken from a conversation with Holly Herndon in *Bristol In Stereo* magazine, May 2019. Which means I can link to [this excellent song](https://youtu.be/r4sROgbaeOs)- her album is some of the most thrilling music I have listened to in the last few months.

I'm also really honoured to have a poem in the latest issue of Marble Poetry. [Check it out here.](http://marblepoetry.com/product/issue-7/)

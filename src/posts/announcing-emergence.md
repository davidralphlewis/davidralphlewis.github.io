A few years ago, I stumbled on an article about the idea of panpsychicism where consciousness is a part of everything. In this theory, the face we can think and dream is an emergent property of the universe itself. I'm not sure I fully believe this theory, but something about it stuck with me.

Now, three or four year later I've written a little poetry pamphlet around the theme. It's called *Emergence* and has twenty poems dealing with the thoughts and dreams of atoms, hives, humans and the cosmos. Writing the poems was also an excuse to experiment with form, so I had fun with formatting the poems to reflect the content. It's very much a project that needs to be on the page. I've enjoyed creating a physical book after making [Reality Adjustments.](https://davidralphlewis.itch.io/reality-adjustments)

Here's the cover:

A huge thanks to [Barry Hollow](https://linktr.ee/barryhollow) and [Stanley Iyanu](https://linktr.ee/StanleyIyanu) who read a previous version of the pamphlet and gave feedback. It's taken a long time to get to the final stage and they both helped me clarify and edit the sprawling mess of poems.

It's available to pre order now [here](https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com/product/emergence). It costs Â£7 plus postage, with 30 copies available. I hope to ship them out by 12th September. 

I hope you enjoy it.

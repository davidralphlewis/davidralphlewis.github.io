## Parallel  

The clouds have been kind for once.  
I have no other choice than to lie  
in a field and let the sun dry me out.  
This moment hangs. Birds hover,  
suspended instead of swooping.  
Luxuriating in the magnificence  
of just being, I half close my eyes.  

In the edges of my weak vision,  
uncountable universes multiply  
trillions spinning from every second,  
slight variations on every rule.  
Where this pleasant sun burns  
too fast and too bright. Where I am in this  
same field but with a stranger.  
Where the ice age never ended.  
Where I never was and would never be.  

Gasping, I open my eyes and try to hold  
the infinite kalidescope still,  
but inevitably the glass shatters.  
The possibilities reduce down to one.

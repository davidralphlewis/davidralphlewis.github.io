All these whirring, vibrant blurs,  
this rare and joyous music,  
the sensation of breeze over bare skin  
as I twirl in the summer sun  
dizzy, exhilarated, smiling-

All of that was a fantasy.  
A fever dream of a frantic mind.  
So why are my eyes damp?  

The shadows continue their looping dance  
flickering in the flamelight over limestone  
I watch them swirl and merge   
letting the dream diminish.

I define myself by edges--my skin,   
car bonnets- but I am oh so permeable.   
Chest matching thumpthumpthump of potholes.   
Clemency lies between radio stations,   
in the pause before windshield wipers   
swish back to starting positions.   
Hands tapping morse on the steering wheel,   
messages to distant and unseen agents.  
My party trick is dissolving into vapour.   
Rumble strips and cat's eyes broadcast:  
"Forget all you know. Unlearn your old self.   
A new world is forming in articulated lorry spray.   
Rewild your petty dreams and ambitions."  
Infusing clouds reach swirling fingers  
to stroke my embossed flesh, damp comfort.

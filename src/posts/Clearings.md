Violent patches, forgotten space  
where green is crushed,   
where green shudders to mud,   
where green becomes tarmac   

for fear of possible roots     
for fear of small rebellions    
of cracks and fear of life     
bursting uncontrolled    
spiralling towards the distant sky.   

Vigilant now are the foresters,    
their blades honed sharp by dread.    
Concrete churns interrupting each   
fluorescent sulphur night.    

A continual fire will still leave shoots    
alive by chance. In the ashes,    
something is shivering in the breeze    
-vital, forgotten, new.

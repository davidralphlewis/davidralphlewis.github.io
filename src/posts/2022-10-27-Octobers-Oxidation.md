Drains are clogged with circuit boards again.  
Flurries of rust flakes carpet the streets.  
All the air tastes of wet pennies. Every  
polished gear and lever is corroding fast  
under the pressures of time. Gutters, pipes  
peel off houses and droop. Children swing  
rivets on strings, laugh in modem screeches.  
Pull on your coat. Leave the Geiger counter  
on the kitchen side. Let's walk together,  
despite this antifreeze rain, feel the crunch  
and pop of ball bearings beneath our feet.  
Down in the landfill, bottles of bleach  
are waiting for spring to erupt and bloom.

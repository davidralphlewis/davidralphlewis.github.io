In this Christmas film, Tiny Tim is wrapped   
in yellowed sheets, fever embracing him tight.  
Unnamed family members stand round the bed  
muttering 'rhubarb rhubarb rhubarb' to give  
the illusion of speech. Not long to go now.   
Then a swell of strings, spotlight narrows -   
A miracle! Tiny Tim sits upright in bed  
and starts to tell weeping extras a story of  

the woman from the big city who was fired as a lawyer and now has returned to her home town to open a cupcake bakery, and the handyman who hateloves her high falutin ways. A freak blizzard traps them in a cabin- impossibly neat and perfectly designed - so not knowing what else to do they sit on the expensive sofa, turn on the television and watch

a wrinkled hand draw  
shapes in thick ash  
in the shade   
of rusting trees  
'Gather round'  
stomachs complain  
'Gather round!  
I'll tell you a story  
of frozen water falling  
from the sky, of trees  
inside, an abundance    
of light everywhere  
and the long peace.'  
Pan to a faded photograph  
half buried under rubble   
that shows

your living room. There you are.   
Sat watching the Christmas film.  
There is the back of your head.   
You turn to face the camera -

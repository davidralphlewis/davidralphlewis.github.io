'You don't want to end up like me,'   
the man on stage screeches.    
Laughter unstoppable now, like   
a falling body embracing gravity.    
'I'm serious. Why is that funny?'    
I feel three hundred people's heat  

so I shift outside my self, ceiling    
too low, too close, I can't climb far,    
watch myself from above, stumble    
past seated and slumped patrons    
into the comfort of a dark aisle    
'It wasn't that bad, was it?'    
I hear far below, carried upwards    
on the whistle of cold air    
before heavy auditorium doors      
swing open, release me in a rush.   

I pull up now, seeking space   
my head a dot below as I fly.    
Bald patch not as bad as I thought   
The world retreats to silence    

a woman speaks in gusts and squalls     
pull the ripcord in my head    
catch an updraft, higher now,    
float in a sea of absence    

a person collapsing below    
distant panic and laughter

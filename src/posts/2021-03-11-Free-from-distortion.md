Taken from a old *New Yorker*, no idea which issue.

A few bits of news:

- I made a really strange puzzle page for the latest issue of [*Welcome to Bear Creek*](https://www.welcometobearcreek.com/puzzles). Thanks so much to them. The whole issue is strange and beautiful, go check it out.

- Sam Cavender (who shot the headshot on my home page) took this crazy UV portrait of me in a park. (We were socially distant at all times.) He is an actual wizard:

Check out his [photography here.](https://www.instagram.com/samsnapsalot/)

- I've been reading out my pamphlet [*Refraction*](/refractionpamphlet) over on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis). It's been a lot of fun! I've enjoyed revisiting the poems and making something new out of them. I've also released the pdf for free. [Download it here.](/refractionpamphlet)

It's released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), so please share, remix, add or alter it if you want. It's yours.

It's free but if you want to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/davidralphlewis) it would be much appreciated, but is by no means essential.

If you prefer a physical version, I've got a handful of copies left if you want one, available at my [shop.](https://davidralphlewis.bigcartel.com) Thanks to everyone who has bought one so far.

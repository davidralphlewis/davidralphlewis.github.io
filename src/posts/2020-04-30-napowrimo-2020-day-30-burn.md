I expect these days to fade like    
photographs left on a windowsill.    
That's the hope. The numbers will    
blur, the weeks will drain of detail     
and colour and I will be left with    
outlines and vague shapes, glimpses    
of faces in the washed-out clouds,    
voices speaking through the hiss.    

But I'll remember the constant dread    
every time the radio cut to a bulletin,    
how the cruelty of those in charge was    
too obvious to ignore. I'll remember    
watching the trees bloom with wonder,    
asking myself how beauty could still    
emerge around us. I'll remember the sun    
stroking our faces despite everything,    
warming us before starting on the slow    
obliteration, over-exposing our thoughts.

Final prompt was "What Will you Remember?" from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/amykaypoetry/">AmyKayPoetry</a>. I've tried to avoid writing directly about the crisis as thousands have said many wise and helpful things. With this prompt, it felt appropriate to address it.  

I'm done! Thanks for all your support in this

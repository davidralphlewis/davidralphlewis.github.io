Listen, in between these seconds    
plummeting like raindrops - 

away from your constant   
rotation of breath,   
tuning out a fuzzing   
whirr of fans, the growl   
of idling engines - 

behind it all, unnoticed    
the slow churn of a motor    
deep in the planets core,   

and below, a cosmic bass note    
(the wheel grinding)   

and distant still,   
beyond all that commotion-    
all the frantic cycles of our being,   
faint, forgotten -   

the click of apertures,   
the scratch of pens.

those placeholders for unspoken  
sorrow, please send instead  
the first sunny morning in spring  
when mist evoprates like breath  
as buildings and smiles are preserved   
in amber. Send vivid, realistic dreams  
where you reunite with long dead  
friends who embrace you and laugh  
and ask 'Why you are so distressed,  
can't you see everything is fine?'

We will accept the sudden shock  
of diving into a still lake   
on a drowsy gold afternoon,   
an accidental graze of a hand   
that transmits sparks and even   
a fleeting glimpse of a buzzard,   
hovering beside the motorway,   
so still.  

Thank you in advance for your  
moments, all anyone has to give.

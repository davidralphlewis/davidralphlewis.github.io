becoming more than simple root by  
breathing in sweet loam  
rolling a body into a pebble  
churning under the surface  
while dreaming deep in fever  
of the power to divide  
endlessly, divide endlessly  
while never blinking  

<pre>
						            while above in the world of the living
                        doing what is necessary and expected, 
                        opening green arms, small violet flowers, 
                        drinking down our star in great gulps
                        
</pre>
while buried the hunger of dreaming  
the punishing demands of deep sleep  
never blinking, dreams of universes  
splitting like cells, each one  
a smooth stone, buried, never blinking,  
churning itself into a pebble,  
a deep groan in the middle of night  
rolling new limbs and pulling bodies apart  
to bury and send out new shoots from all corpses,   
weaving light into legion into fever delusions  
of soil, never blinking, crawling by division  
over decades, churning and rolling bodies  
and bodies and tubers and bodies and bodies

I am driving home at night  
hands gripping the wheel  
empty tarmac surrounding me  
fertiliser stinging my nostrils  
The engine shaking all the space  
between my scattered atoms  

as white lines converge  

scattered atoms of steel  
shake in engine vibrations   
fertiliser drifts from nearby fields  
the empty tarmac sighs   
someone else's hands grip  
a steering wheel as a car  
drives on, into darkness.

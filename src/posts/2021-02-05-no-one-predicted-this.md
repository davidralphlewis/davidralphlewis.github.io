We've done everything we possibly can  
they proclaim on nightly broadcasts,  
shaking their fists for emphasis as if  
describing ineffective ancient magic  
runes in the air, as globs of engine oil   
dribble down their chins, distracting   
from the soft focus, where shadows   
tear copper wire from the concrete.  

We've done all we can, they inisist   
in their two thousand pound a piece   
newspaper columns, before huffing   
furniture polish, snorting ground  
rare turtle eggs and sitting down    
to a subsidised pre-luncheon of     
flammable cladding shavings over    
satueed arms deals and steamed   
dreams. They ask the staff to turn   
up the music, block out the sirens,   
the near constant rise and fall   
from cold streets, indistinguishable  
from the wails of hungry children.  

We've simply done everything we can   
they proclaim, whilst frantically    
issuing bills, edits and emergency   
agreements that say nothing at all.   
We stop listening, but aren't surprised   
when we find our mostly methane river   
catching fire on hot days, feel rain   
of razor blades fall over our naked   
flesh, run our taps for some water,   
watch our sinks bubble and corrode.   

Listen, we've done everything we can,   
they plead on billboards and radio   
interviews, while filling their pockets   
with piles of precious gems and futures,   
flinging contracts at any incorporated   
friend, sealing themselves in airtight   
packaging, posting themselves first class   
to their isolated third homes (the ones   
that are registered to their daughters   
for tax reasons you understand), while   
a hundred thousand pairs of eyes  
filled with ash and soil, look on   

unblinking.

Less a poem and more a rant, this has been circling in my mind since last week. I hope it will be less relevant in time.

During the second spring,   
gorse opened exploratory  
canary buds, lending  
a perfume of coconut  
to apathetic winds.

The ground slept, twitched.  
A faint to forget   
the warmest year.  

I shuffle in enforced  
slow motion decay,   
rusty wool wrapping me. 

Under the frozen pond  
scored with desire lines  
of dreaming crystalline-  
slight flutters, small hearts.

I see needles made swords  
spring slumbering under frost  
Buds now fading suns.

This was written in a slow single waltz  
before the next one  

This morning I feel like a strange conversation  
with the discomfort of my head  
and the contact of your language is a way to make sure  
This morning is the first time I've been maintaining the water  
finally and the seed is going to go with your advice  
This morning I have a refund for my part time job in London  
and I have been told that the rhythm of your language
is a better man than I  

<!--more-->

These days are the hardest things to get in the way  

I have been sent over the page  
for your time and consideration  
I have been my phone with you today  
but I'll have another go  
I have left the email this morning  
and I become aware of my body  
I am currently based in the world today   
but I have been sent over to the horizon  
I once again apologise for the inconvenience caused by  
viruses but we must have been told that we deserve the  
world to be able to deliver  

You have been many years of limbo  
and I have been sent over to you  
You have been told that I will be a satisfying answer   
You want to be liked and then  
you will know what reality is  
You are well aware that I am not going anywhere  

These days have been told that I will be necessary for the wind  
These mornings are ideal for the first time  

You are a number of people who are infinite

This was a prompt from [Bristol Tonic](https://www.facebook.com/BristolTonic/). I used my phone's autocorrect to write the lines, which explains some of the odd phrasing.

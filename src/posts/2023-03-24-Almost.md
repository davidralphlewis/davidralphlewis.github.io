and yes, I still gathered branches,  
and yes, I still wore my woollen coat,  
but it was unbuttoned, no scarf  

and yes, my skin still raised in surprise,  
and yes, the sky still heralded rain,  
but the sun was a paintbrush, not a scalpel  

and yes, many branches were still bare  
but tight buds were gently unspooling  
and the grass rioted in damson and mustard  

and yes, warmer and more expansive days  
were diving towards me on golden wings

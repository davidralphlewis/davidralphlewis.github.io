Briefly, over lightly settled night,  
tungsten filaments flame out.  
Sunk in owl hoots and the scratching   
of small claws on terracotta pots,   
we feel the planet spin below our feet     
so fast there's no chance for dizziness.  

Particles fizzle and burn in thin   
danger, flickering bright shock   
for us sat below to wish upon-    
falling, forgotten disintegration.   
My outer limits shiver distant.  

I am cloud behind emerging stars,    
scattered galaxy visible only through    
deep darkness and quiet attention,  
diffuse yet bound together by gravity,   

like the meteoroids we meet yearly   
like my body, tumbling through voids   
clinging onto a small rock, only   
occasionally noticing that down is relative.

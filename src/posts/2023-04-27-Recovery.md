Somewhere, possibly close, the kettle boils.  
I am waiting for my insides to knit together  
around an absence, watching petals a shade  
off clouds emerge on phalanx thin branches.

RNA is imprinted with memory, like lore.  
Most days I attempt to escape myself   
with bright lights and pleasant fictions.   
Scattered stem cells turn, united as one.   

Naming is violence, so I resist identifying  
the birds that visit daily, just watch wings   
flash egg yolk, variegated vine, shimmering  
petrol spill; collecting seeds for longer days.

From waterlogged soil, from the base of a cut down   
magnolia tree, I stretch towards an ink blot sky  
stitching out of sap a fresh spinal cord.

Return your charade of a citadel back    
to the abundant soil, the loan from loam   

now long overdue and incurring fines.    
Rewild your infrastructure, your houses,  

both parliament and domestic. Break bricks   
down into constituent concepts and allow   

new buds to bloom where walls once crouched.   
Your bone marrow and personality quirks could  

become fertile compost for the new world.   
These words, shredded, are rich in carbon.

Erasure poem taken from Crack Magazine, February 2023. This one really just developed from the erasure.

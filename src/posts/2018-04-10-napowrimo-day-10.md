## Unwritten  

I had been sleeping in segments  
like an essay you can't concentrate on  
and write in sloppy short paragraphs  
before stopping. I was inbetween waking  
and dreaming most days, half asleep  
in the day, half awake at night.  

That one night I must have been asleep  
although I felt wide awake and wired.  
My vision was engulfed in brightness;  
beautiful vision of shock and awe,  
hideous in its consuming beauty.  
I knew, instinctively, like pulling  
your hand from the fire, this was  
a Being five dimensions removed  
from my pathetic flesh and thought,  
constructed from the light beyond sight.  

Strange movements amongst the beams,  
shades and patterns dancing over me,  
a language I now cannot comprehend  
but at the time I understood as words.  
In my fugue state, a poem was dictated,  
verses that contained the answers to  
every question, the meaning of time  
and the rhythms and lines that could  
set a universe into joyous motion.  
I wept to hear it. I swore I would be  
its unworthy terrestrial messenger.  

I woke, for certain this time, lost in  
the hours before the world stirred.  
Searching for a pen, I already felt the words  
pour out of my memory, like sand grains  
through an open palm. When I finally  
located a chewed biro, my head was empty.  

I was left shivering and half awake,  
unsure of why I was gripping a pen,  
unsure of the time or my location  
unsure even of who or what I was.  

The dawn chorus had erased the divine

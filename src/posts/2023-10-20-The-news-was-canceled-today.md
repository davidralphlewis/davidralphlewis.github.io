because there was no danger or threat,  
no unwanted developments. There were no murders  
because we melted down our knives and guns  
to build homes, schools and hospitals for everyone.  
War is now an archaic word, like famine  
or suffering. Climate change was solved years ago  
and every person has enough to eat and drink,  
has all the resources and support they need  
to thrive. Governments erased borders.
Money was always fictional, but now everyone  
acknowledges it. Of course, people still die,   
but it is never unexpected and always  
surrounded by those they love. We know
every human regardless of race, gender, religion  
or anything other difference, is a bright candle  
that needs to be cradled and we need everyone   
combined together to light up the dark.  

So the news anchors stood up from their desks,   
wiped off their makeup  
disconnected their ear pieces  
and wandered out of the studio  
into the peace of the forest.   
Under an emerald canopy   
they kicked off   
their sensible shoes  
and felt soil and soft moss  
between their toes  
as dappled light danced  
for joy over their skin.

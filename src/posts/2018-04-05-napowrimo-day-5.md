## Boundary  

I am mostly empty,  
Ninety-nine percent space.  

A rough carbon frame  
held up by electricity.  

There is no border between  
my body and the world.  

Dreams bleed out into  
the air, leaping sparks  

carried by electrons  
into continual near nothing  

I touch a table and  
almost fall through.  

In that last fraction  
lies everything.

## Escape  

In the dissonant hours, when clouds  
envelop you, when your feet are lead,  
when the city is monochrome,  
grab my hand tight and together  

we will forget about gravity,  
(the rules are merely optional)  
and saunter together into the sky  
to conga above the clouds.  

Our flight will be in technicolour.  
No longer constrained, we will strut  
and hop, leave behind the stratosphere  
and pirouette between the stars.

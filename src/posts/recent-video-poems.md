I set myself a secret goal over the last three months -  to make at least three videos out of my poems. I didn't really have any clue about what I was doing, but I'd seen Barry Hollow and Caleb Parkin make some so thought I'd give it a go. I dove in with no real idea about shooting footage, video editing or audio mixing.

In the end, I ended up making four videos, two taken from my pamphlet Emergence two of other poems I had written.

They are crude, amateurish and low quality. There's so many things I would have done differently, using better footage and a better microphone instead of just my phone for example. But I'm glad I made them still.

The last video I made was the city poem, and unlike the others I used cuts and built up footage, timing the voiceover to match. It's still not great by any means but it's progress of a sort.

The process reminded me of starting to write poetry, or making this blog. Jumping into a new project with little idea of how it works and figuring it out on the way. The learning comes from the process. In the doing and making of of stuff you figure things out. It's a good reminder to start projects before you are ready and a reminder you don't always need to do hours of research before you begin. Just start and hope for the best.

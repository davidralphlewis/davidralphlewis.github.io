The destination displays are corrupted  
again. Carriages and corridors converge  
on the horizon, a lifetime's walk away.  

> If you look to your left, you will  
> see the same wheat field repeated  
> endlessly, the blur devoid of detail.  

Our mobile phones died decades ago. Good  
books were bartered for the smallest  
pleasures, perhaps a window seat, maybe  
an air vent that isn't clogged with dust.  

> We have a selection of sandwiches   
> available in the buffet car; egg,  
> ploughman's or gravel (no mayo).  

Those who wander too far from their seats  
are quickly forgotten. They become memories  
then stories, then names, then silences.  

> We regret to inform you the past  
> is a black hole and it is hungry.  

Mostly, we sit very still and listen to  
our toenails grow, millimetre by millimetre.

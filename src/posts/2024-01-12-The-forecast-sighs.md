Amber and scarlet triangles describe   
the island. These winding lanes

are dead screens. As I push forward,    
I am a lone faulty pixel in darkness. 

Puddles erupt in sudden static bursts.   
This night lies between number stations. 

I drive onwards, seeking the source,   
shell swallowed by the detuned gloom.

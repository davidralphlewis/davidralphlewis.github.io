I have been unable to describe the shape  
of my body. Birds sing laments, mourning  
for our forgotten winter in a language  
only they know, nonsense to me. The sky   
is a sermon printed on cheap paper,  
orange markers bleeding through the page.   
My garden whispers like a fading dream  
as thoughts transmute to smoke,  
wisp and separate and float. Recently  

too many people have died. This fog cloud   
of breath, this speaking in mist feels  
like a betrayal. Against whom I am not sure.  

I watch beech leaves sway like incense,  
invent new scripts in goose pimples,  
inhale the sharp scent of lemon balm,  
that has started to grow through patio cracks.  
Here is my hand, the pale and blotchy skin,  
the small scars from cooking mishaps  
the squat thumb. Here, it is reaching  
to hold the still warm coffee cup,  
vapours of steam like prayers.  

Listen. The robin and the chiff chaff   
are starting to form full sentences.

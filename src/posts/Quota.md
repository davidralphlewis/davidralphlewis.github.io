Once stream, now angry river  
consumes this plot, leaving  
saturated ground squelching.

New meander roars past greenhouse.  
The path of least resistance  
to the ocean through harvests.

Inspector taps teeth with biro lid.   
'See, this needs to be at 48% yield  
at the moment it's only 3.2.'

With renewal notice left unread  
I bury bulbs and old seed in mud  
hoping for a change in weather  
as clouds congregate, grumbling.

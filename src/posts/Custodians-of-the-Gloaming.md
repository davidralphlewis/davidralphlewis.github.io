I have stumbled into the season of crows.   
Still silhouettes watch my lethargic bones   
shuffle through leaf murk into the gloom. 

Issuing decrees in calls, they summon mist -  
uncertainty that lingers over my skin,   
our inevitable destination, dank and decay.   

I bow, of course. Reverence to the gatekeepers,   
the ones that wait between here and nowhere.   
Make peace with their shiny feathers of void,   
ignore their sharpened talons, their pointed beaks.

I've been the forest groaning as the winds pick up,   
a lizard panicking from rock to cool rock as drops fall   
like meteors onto the cracked earth. Mostly, you've    
been a leaky fishing boat anchored outside the bay,    
sinking a little deeper into the churning horizon with a sigh.   
Waves slap higher and harder, evening darkens too soon.   
I've wanted to be a life raft but have found myself    
a hollow statue instead, limestone filling with water.   
Shall we stay put, dance a slow waltz, your head    
on my chest? Shall we linger as sparks appear around   
our eyebrows, as our hair lifts in sudden static surprise?   
Or lets throw on some thrash metal, pull apart our house   
brick by brick, rip apart each and every supporting wall.    
Either way, we'll soon both be sea glass, cloudy   
emerald pools where lightning raged against the sand.

A flutter of flame consumed leaves  
falls onto my crown, drifting embers.  

I breathe in lungfuls of wild fennel  
drifting from nearby fallow fields. 

A buzzard's shriek echoes over clover  
reclaiming every exposed inch of loam.  

I have so much time now.  
I hold it lightly in my hands,  

offer it to the churning sky,  
watch it flit away like a finch.

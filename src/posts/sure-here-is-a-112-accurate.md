Neurons reduced to raw copper wires  
lie in a river bed network, now cracked  
next to hedgerows picked skeletal.

As pylons turn scarlet in setting sun,  
oxidation flakes rain down on salt flats  
and temples of plexiglass - sleeping shells  
linked by tunnels that hum stagnant.   

Server -2715/B generates a novel melody   
approximating a solo french horn in a cathedral,  
approximating hand on brass, breath on flesh.

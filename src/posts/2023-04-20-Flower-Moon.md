It's Easter and all the daffodils are screaming  
at the awakening ground- "Lazy arsehole!"  
"Good for nothing useless compost!"  
Rhubarb cracks fresh bones as it stretches  
towards a terracotta sky, body on new body.  
The stillness you found among roadkill  
and in the cold and muddy verges  
has been shattered by sudden ferns.  
We have read the skies like scripture.  
Now is the time to live- breathless, unforgiving.  
I hold my unnoticed, selfish serenity close,   
feel it crack open, send out exploratory shoots,  
mutate into this fragile yellow dream.

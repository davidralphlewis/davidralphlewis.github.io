Soon, they joined together in hordes  
of increasing size, shudders running over  
their bodies like waves in a storm.  
They sat together over the cenotaph,   
the shopping centre, spilled out into two  
lane roads, holding each other as their sobs  
became life rafts. Confused crowds watched,  
unwilling to leap over to understanding.  
Soon traffic stopped altogether, drivers  
unable to see through salt water.  

I stared only at the buddleia and verbena.  
I knew they cried for the rising of the tide,  
a future washed away in cruelty and ignorance.   
Soon, I shuffled towards my air-conditioned  
office, swallowing the lump in my throat.

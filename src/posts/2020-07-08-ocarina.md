Do you remember the first time  
you saw those mountains? How they  
towered above you? Do you remember  
your unbounded freedom, how paths  
lay before you, infinite in choice,  
how the sun spun above you and grass  
regrew at your feet? How you would play  
your strange instrument to bring forth  
new light upon the surface of Hyrule?  

Now, you have become an adult, changing  
within seconds, your childhood abandoned.  
You do not remember when you grew so tall,  
when the clouds gathered, the sky darkened,  
when these streets emptied of people only to  
fill again with your slow nightmares.  
Now the temple lies in ruins, havoc  
has become sacred. You see simple cubes   
behind all matter. The legend no longer  
makes sense. If only you knew a song  
to take you back to the simplicity  
of childhood, those fairy-blessed days.

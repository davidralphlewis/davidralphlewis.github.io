<h2>Language</h2>

<p>I ask the rain for answers<br />  
but it offers no reply,<br />  
just a gentle tip tip tap<br />  
annointing my forehead.</p>  


  
<p>I want to speak the same words<br />  
as the indifferent sun<br />  
or babble with the brooks<br />  
in quiet flowing tones.</p>  


  
<p>So much remains unknown.<br /> In thousands of lifetimes<br /> we may, together, learn a word<br /> of an infinite lexicon.</p>  


  
<p>I try to converse with the wind<br />  
but it does not answer back.<br />  
With soft and tender hands<br />  
it ruffles through my hair.</p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

I came into office  
*because in my possession was an ancient grimoire,*  
at a time of great economic and international instability  
*from which a few will profit, the system working as it should.*  
Families and businesses were worried about  
*being suspended over a bottomless chasm with sharp teeth;*  
about how to pay their bills;  
*about flesh chewed down by ice, no help forthcoming.*  

Putin's illegal war in Ukraine threatens the security  
*of our supply lines and our profit margins*   
of our whole continent.   
*We do not think about those huddled in shelled buildings.*  
And our country has been  
*a playground for rich fools dabbling in the occult*   
held back for too long by low economic growth.  
*All hail eternal expansion, the flame that never flickers.*  

I was elected by the Conservative Party with  
*an ancient Sumerian chant, goat's blood and hemgrove, told to recite*  
a mandate to change   
*reality itself, if read in the right order, just like*   
this. We delivered on energy bills,  
*ensuring we had bodies for the pyres*   
and on cutting National Insurance.  
*The abyss gurgled with joy. We praised the great devourer.*   
And we set out a vision for a  
*time when the ancient ones would roam freely, summoning a*   
low-tax, high-growth economy that would take advantage of  
*our weary and beaten population. How many will we sacrifice to gain*   
the freedoms of Brexit.  

I recognise, though, given the situation,  
*our rituals were ineffective. We were so certain.*  
I cannot deliver the mandate on which I was elected  
*because the stars have grown cold, destroyed*   
by the Conservative Party.  

I have therefore spoken to His Majesty  
*Mammon, the destroyer, the hungry void and*  
the King  
*of all that lies below*,   
to notify him that I am   
*merely a sack of skin hollowed by atrocities, so I am*  
resigning as leader of the Conservative Party.  
*I preached consumption and was surprised when I was consumed.*  

This morning, I met the chairman of the  
*order, the high priest of the fearful*  
1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady.   
*I offered my neck in penance but was denied release.*  
We've agreed  
*to sleep in shadows, waiting the perfect time. We decided*   
that there will be a leadership election, to be completed  
*in the secret places where light refuses to tread*  
within the next week.  

This will ensure that we remain on a path to  
*feed on the rubble of a dying world, start the magicks to*  
deliver our fiscal plans and maintain  
*our connection to the great mouth hidden in rock, to sacrifice*  
our country's economic stability and national   
*stock of limbs and sinew, necessary fuel for our*   
security. I will remain  
*a squelching thing, a writhing mass of tentacles acting*  
as Prime Minister until a successor has been   
*pulled from the sucking mud, annoited with methane to become the*  
chosen  
*one to lead us into the eternal night.*  
Thank you.

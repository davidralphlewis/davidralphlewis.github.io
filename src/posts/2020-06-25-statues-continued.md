After [yesterday's post](/myths-of-history/), I happened to be reading *The People's History of the United States* by Howard Zinn. He writes about the reaction to the protests about Columbus statues in the nineties:

> This aroused anger among defenders of the old history, who derided what they called a movement for "political correctness" and "multiculturalism". They resented the critical treatment of Western expansion and imperialism, which they considered an attack on Western civilisation.

The more things change, the more they stay the same.

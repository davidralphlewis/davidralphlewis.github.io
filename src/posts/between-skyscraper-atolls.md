vast vague humanoid machines    
plunge deep into gloom and glide;   
each elbow engine oil encased;  
each articulated camera swivelling,  
scanning sea beds for patterns.

Pilot transmissions chitter:  
'Circle back, synergy is lacking   
due to organisational priorities'   
'Affirmative. I'll put time in   
your calendar.' 'Let's regroup'   

Remnant artefact search delayed.  
Amber distilled in convex steel  
rising above concave waves.

To the horizon then,   
to mornings combing in  
brine and tides, where   
sunlight twists and twirls  
describing in dance steps  
buried avenues, unfamiliar signs   
once useful wheeled machines  
abandoned to salt, rust  
and the continual swirl  
and sway of hushed depths.

<h2>Playback</h2>  
<!-- /wp:heading -->  

  
<p>Lying in bed awake as the city sleeps,<br />the events of the day play before her<br />like a scratched and dusty DVD. Incidents<br />unfold out of sequence, sentences<br />skip and repeat and fall out of sync.<br />As the pause button fails again, she tries <br />to listen to calming sirens instead. </p>

<p>All the poems I wrote last year are available as an ebook for free. It's called <em>Lost in April Fog </em>and you can <a href="/aprilfog/">download it here. </a></p>

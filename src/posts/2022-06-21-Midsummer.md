Our days are longest now, we hold the light  
solid between our fingers, like putty,  
before twirling, once more unstoppable.  
These are days we dream of deep in winter,  
when we are	banished in	eternal night.  
These are days suffused	with strange rare magicks,  
when our flame bodies flicker translucent.  
We manifest	what we will. Morning sparks  
alchemical. Our fingertips bristle.  
Play the music! Let us unite as one  
before the world tips inevitably  
back towards the shortening hours of sun.  
How precious these illuminated days.  
How soon, like warm embers, they start to fade.

you ask me, sitting on the smashed roof tiles  
and concrete slabs that used to be our home.   
We are drinking rainwater and petrol  
from a puddle, drying our t-shirts  
on the newly exposed wire foundations.   
We watch the sky flash orange and violet,   
feel the rumbles deep inside our ribcages.

'No', I reply, 'we shouldn't get involved.   
Besides, we've got too much cleaning up to do.'  
as I gesture at all the debris  
and try to disregard the endless rise   
and fall of the sirens  
getting closer

Written very quickly in the half time of Bristol Tonic. Prompt was the title. Thanks as always to them.

I'm uploading a few videos to YouTube. Here's me reading my  poem 'Missed Connection'

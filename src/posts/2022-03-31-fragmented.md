* I was delighted to be asked onto the Full House Literary Podcast talking about poetry and mental health. It was a thought provoking, interesting discussion that was quite wide ranging. Thanks so much to them for having me on, listen [here.](https://www.fullhouseliterary.com/podcast-epsisodes/mental-health-and-writing-roundtable) 

* Speaking of poetry, I'm volunteering at [Lyra Festival](https://www.lyrafest.com/) in Bristol over the next couple of weeks. It looks to be a really fascinating series of events, I'm also competing in the slam. If you'd like to come along to the qualifying rounds you can sign up on zoom [here.](https://www.lyrafest.com/#events/e72148) 

* After swearing never to do it again, I've given this site another spruce up. I replaced my creaking, stapled together code with theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) and I'm a lot happier with it. I've also spruced up my [notes pages](https://notes.davidralphlewis.co.uk/) to make them more legible and removed all analytics. I don't have any comments on the pages either so now the only way to contact me is by email. A bit of a spring clean of my digital footprint. I'm pleased with this latest evolution of the site, it's much more how I wanted it to be.

John Green's podcast *The Anthropocence Reviewed* has been a consistent highlight this year, but the <a href="https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/audio.wnyc.org/anthropocene-reviewed/anthropocene-reviewed122619_auldlangsyne.mp3">latest episode</a> on Auld Lang Syne is particularly moving. The reworking of the song and reclamation of it is joyous.  

It made me think about why we celebrate New Year. The answer John Green gives is an elegant one; because we are all still here. Another journey around the sun, another year passing into history.  

Hold each other tight and revel in each other's company. No matter what happens, we have these moments of joy and closeness. We have each other for a little time on this strange planet.  

Happy new year everyone. I hope 2020 is better for us all.

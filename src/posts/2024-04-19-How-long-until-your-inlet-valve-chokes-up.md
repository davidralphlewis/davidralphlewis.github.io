with lint and grime? Oil seeps into every    
exposed surface, delays the build up of rust,    
but decline is inevitable. When did you last    
consider your camshaft bearing, your crankshaft   
drillings, your line shaft? You forgot to follow    
the established maintenance schedule,   
didn't you? Made a checklist then delayed   
consulting it. Eventually, your pistons    
will stop pumping, a spark plug will fail,    
your alternator will burn out or a wire     
to your battery will fray. How much grease     
lines the walls of your intake manifold?   
Is it enough? When did a professional   
last give you a look over? Your catalytic   
convertor is clogged, you are speaking   
in toxic fumes. How long has your engine   
management light been flashing on and off?

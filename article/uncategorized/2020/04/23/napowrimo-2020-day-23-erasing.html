<meta name="description" content="“I know how this goes!” I say to no-one as light starts to intensify, obliterating all detail. Trees will become indistinct shapes in the mist, never coalescing into objects. The grass will flicker with blue fire sparks, but that will be the least of my problems. Walls, so dependable and solid, will become transparent as the hungry light feeds. “Bring it on!” I will shout towards the rapidly dissolving sky. “So predictable! You’re not even trying!” I will scream as the outline of my body transforms into scattered pencil smudges, as my carbon is disassembled, as I become the cyclone. “C minus!!” I will shout, “Unlucky, try a lot harder next time!” Prompt was the first line “I know how this goes…” from Apples and Snakes. They are also doing some great readings over on their youtube channel, so check those out." />

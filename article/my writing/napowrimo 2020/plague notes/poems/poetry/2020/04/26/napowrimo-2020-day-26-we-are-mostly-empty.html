<meta name="description" content="As we tumbled through the void, everything was calm and peaceful if you ignored the constant drone of spycraft. The air was pink electric and crackled with potential There was something struggling within it, something hidden, unseen. It shimmered in the air, made of nothing at all, blinking on and off, a broken sunbeam. It had walked for years, over burning deserts, stumbling over broken glass and sharp shingle beaches. Whispers and noises from other dimensions combined, a palimpsest of imagined voices. As I surrendered, my head filled with static. I forget the boundaries between us. We became one living pulsing mass that screamed and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked. We tasted foil. We heard a great tearing of metal, groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming at each other. We saw the strings of the universe clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk. Prompt was to “Look back through your old writing notebooks and make a collage poem from discarded lines and free writes.” from Apples and Snakes. I adjusted some for tenses and added in a few connectives, but mostly this is from my notebook. Wish I knew what this was about or what the lines meant when I wrote them down." />

<meta name="description" content="Given the kindness and cruelty of time, a majority forgot those years where the tilt of the earth increased. Only a degree. Or more. Scientists spoke, we didn’t listen, lost in our own panic, sick with adrenaline. Maybe others were able to convince themselves by repetition: It wasn’t that bad. We pulled together. It wasn’t that bad. What they omit is the months of still night, a numbness that never left, the dread- this situation was static, we had buried our normality with axes under the ice floes that spread arms down from the north, over city towers, consuming mountains, farms and futures. A new ice age. Mostly I woke, limbs numb, wondering how I would endure the day. I always did. And given enough days, even the glaciers melted and receded, leaving behind new altered landscapes, sun painted gifts for our patience. Prompt was to “Write a poem including the words ‘forgot’, ‘maybe’ and ‘tilt’” from the Poetry in the Time of Being Alone Group" />

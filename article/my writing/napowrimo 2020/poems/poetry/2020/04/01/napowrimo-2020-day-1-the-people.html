<meta name="description" content="We the spin, the shimmer. We the sway, the light, the contagion and the cure We the anointing and sometimes the penance. We the living cosmos. We who stockpile flocks of wings in our hearts and galaxies in our eyes. We the sun on the river in the morning. We, barely glimpsed, we the golden and the gentle, we the shine and the reflection. We the rare, the cruel and the wonderful. We the infinite and the brief. We who have been searching for millennia, in the skies and in the hedgerows. We who are still searching. We who strive for transcendence and find it, now and then. Prompt was “Write a poem that includes the words ‘flock’ ‘simmer’ and ‘sway” I misread simmer for shimmer. I drafted one poem and didn’t like it, so I ran it through a cut up machine, which twisted my words. Then I wrote out from that." />

<p>Prompt was “Write a poem that includes the words ‘flock’ ‘simmer’ and ‘sway” I misread simmer for shimmer. I drafted one poem and didn’t like it, so I ran it through a <a href="http://www.languageisavirus.com/cutupmachine.php">cut up machine</a>, which twisted my words. Then I wrote out from that.</p>

<meta name="description" content="Seemingly infinite, the night sky is the most consistent falsehood. The moon is nothing more than a hologram, the stars just dead pixels in the screen constructed millennia ago to keep us placid. Reality is narrated to us daily. Your thoughts are not your own. You are code blind, lost within a procedurally generated lie. Look to the glitches. The single side of the moon, the vanishing stars, memories of new places. You say I’m not making sense, that you are worried about me, not knowing you speak in lines written for you. We walk home, or appear to, arm in arm along the canal, agreeing to exist within fiction a little longer. When we are asleep, the program malfunctions, showing us glimpses of new scenarios, other realities. Today’s prompt was conspiracy theories from the Poetry at the time of being alone group. I was lucky enough to be on a couple of podcasts recently. I read my poem ‘Failed Hypothesis’ as part of Dead Darlings’ open mic episode. Find that here. My day two poem for napowrimo, “I only went to a psychic for an ego boost” was read and analysed on the Hack Sessions podcast. Find that here. Thanks to both for featuring me." />

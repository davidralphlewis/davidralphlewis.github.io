<meta name="description" content="Today my mind is like confetti thrown to the wind, like a website with every space filled with adverts, all flashing for my attention, like a river delta as hundreds of tributaries race towards the ocean. Do you understand? It’s like I’ve drunk ten espressos and all I can hear is the thumping house beat of my heart or like I am dust in the depths of the galaxy not yet ready to coalesce into planets. You must know what I mean. It’s like I’m a beam of light shot through a prism, or my thoughts are cryptic crossword clues or I’m a CRT television stuck between channels, half images looping back over themselves. What I’m trying to say is I’m like a lizard darting across hot sands, it’s like I’m caught in a washing machine near the end of the cycle, like I’ve become a comet entering the atmosphere before inevitably burning, disintegrating, becoming nothing more than fine ash rain. Prompt was “Gimme Simile- really pack those similies in” from AmyKay Poetry. One day left!" />

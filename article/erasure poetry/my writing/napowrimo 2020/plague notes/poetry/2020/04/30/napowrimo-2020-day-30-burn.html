<meta name="description" content="I expect these days to fade like photographs left on a windowsill. That’s the hope. The numbers will blur, the weeks will drain of detail and colour and I will be left with outlines and vague shapes, glimpses of faces in the washed-out clouds, voices speaking through the hiss. But I’ll remember the constant dread every time the radio cut to a bulletin, how the cruelty of those in charge was too obvious to ignore. I’ll remember watching the trees bloom with wonder, asking myself how beauty could still emerge around us. I’ll remember the sun stroking our faces despite everything, warming us before starting on the slow obliteration, over-exposing our thoughts. Final prompt was “What Will you Remember?” from AmyKayPoetry. I’ve tried to avoid writing directly about the crisis as thousands have said many wise and helpful things. With this prompt, it felt appropriate to address it. I’m done! Thanks for all your support in this" />

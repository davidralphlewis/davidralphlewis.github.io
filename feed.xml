  &lt;li&gt;I’m very grateful to have a poem up on &lt;em&gt;Nine Muses Poetry&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Imposter&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a strange little piece and I’m glad it’s found a good home. Check it out &lt;a href=&quot;https://ninemusespoetry.com/2020/05/14/one-poem-by-david-ralph-lewis/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One of my poems &lt;em&gt;Hollow Passengers&lt;/em&gt; was also set to an awesome improvised soundtrack by Charlie and Jake as part of their Echoes and Edges live stream. It’s such a cool collaborative project and one of the best uses of technology I’ve seen. Check it out below or click through for timings. I recommend watching it all as the whole project is very inventive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;I’m going to be (virtually) on their live stream again this Saturday 16th. Go to &lt;a href=&quot;www.echoesandedges.co.uk&quot;&gt;their site&lt;/a&gt; for more details and links on how to watch.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;fading&quot;&gt;Fading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singing soft chimes under her breath, she&lt;br /&gt;
kisses each ear of wheat, borrows &lt;br /&gt;
yellow from sunflower petals before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;smearing each cloud with evening, takes &lt;br /&gt;
indigo from the blackberries, then stops, &lt;br /&gt;
not satisfied with her canvas. Sighing, she&lt;br /&gt;
grabs a cherry blossom and erases the day &lt;br /&gt;
showing the countless stars behind, waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an acrostic and pastoral workshop. Working within those constraints was really challenging but really useful. By limiting myself, it challenged the language and patterns I usually fall into when making poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the very few advantages of lockdown has been the proliferation of live streamed poetry events. It means I’ve been able to attend a few more than I would do normally and from a wider area. I took part in an online slam the other day with the hosts based in Swindon, which would be too far for me to go for a night in oridnary life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bitter blessing. Nothing beats being in a room with other people but this is the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>DavidRL</name></author><summary type="html">I joined a virtual poetry workshop yesterday run by the wonderful Tonic and wrote this:</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m testing a few things!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/testing/coding/2020/05/09/testing.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I'm testing a few things!" /><published>2020-05-09T11:50:51+01:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T11:50:51+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/testing/coding/2020/05/09/testing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/testing/coding/2020/05/09/testing.html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;everything-is-broken&quot;&gt;Everything is broken&lt;/h1&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I surrendered, my head filled with static.&lt;br /&gt;
I forget the boundaries between us. We&lt;br /&gt;
became one living pulsing mass that screamed&lt;br /&gt;
and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked.&lt;br /&gt;
We tasted foil. We heard a great tearing of metal,&lt;br /&gt;
groaning and wrenching, the stars screaming&lt;br /&gt;
at each other. We saw the strings of the universe&lt;br /&gt;
clear and shimmering, draped in golden silk.&lt;/p&gt;

The air was pink electric and crackled with potential There was something struggling within it, something hidden, unseen. It shimmered in the air, made of nothing at all, blinking on and off, a broken sunbeam. It had walked for years, over burning deserts, stumbling over broken glass and sharp shingle beaches. Whispers and noises from other dimensions combined, a palimpsest of imagined voices. As I surrendered, my head filled with static. I forget the boundaries between us. We became one living pulsing mass that screamed and stamped and roared as one. Our teeth sparked. We tasted foil.

Last year I stored the Atlantic ocean&lt;br /&gt;
behind it, stuffed it into every corner.&lt;br /&gt;
I only just managed to close the latch.&lt;br /&gt;
If opened, the room will fill with brine,&lt;br /&gt;
the house as well, the streets of this&lt;br /&gt;
sea-level town all submerged and we will&lt;br /&gt;
sink down to rest on the carpet below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably wouldn’t open that door either.&lt;br /&gt;
for you will see a short corridor, leading&lt;br /&gt;
to another door, which leads to a short&lt;br /&gt;
corridor, leading to yet another door-&lt;br /&gt;
you get my point. After weeks you may&lt;br /&gt;
turn back, to be faced with the same&lt;br /&gt;
endless recursion of impossible doors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s where I store my collection of&lt;br /&gt;
nebulae and black holes, that one there&lt;br /&gt;
leads straight to the hurricane hangar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only the last one is out of bounds,&lt;br /&gt;
the wooden door a foot high, there&lt;br /&gt;
above the skirting board in the corner.&lt;br /&gt;
I keep the key around my neck on a chain.&lt;br /&gt;
It’s alarmed, but you wouldn’t know it.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s where I keep my worries. Inside,&lt;br /&gt;
a cupboard of ink-stained shadows,&lt;br /&gt;
paper torn into confetti, a whistling,&lt;br /&gt;
quiet and high, with no visible origin.&lt;/p&gt;

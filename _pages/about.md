David Ralph Lewis is a poet and short story writer based in Bristol, UK, whose work has appeared in Neon and DogEar magazines as well as the Lies, Dreaming podcast. He blogs regularly about politics and art and often scrawls over newspapers to create blackout poetry. When not writing, he enjoys dancing badly at gigs, attempting to grow vegetables and taking photos. He understands a very, very small amount of what is going on in the world.

On this website, David maintains a blog about writing, art and politics as well as any other random topic.

You can follow him on [Twitter](www.twitter.com/davidralphlewis), [Instagram](www.instagram.com/davidralphlewis), [Facebook](www.facebook.com/davidralphlewis) and & Goodreads if you want.
